      "Taiwanese regional budget carrierV Air will go out of business in October after less than two years of operation because of competition and low passenger loads, pointing to saturation in its homeland's discount aviation market, airline officials and analysts said.\n",
      "\n",
      "    V Air's parent company TransAsia Airways said on 9 August it would stop all routes by the discount carrier that launched in December 2014 as Taiwan's first locally owned budget airline, TransAsia will pick up two of V Air's seven routes and try to rehire some of its 200 staff people, the company's marketing vice president Chen Yi-Chieh told Asian Aviation, \"In 2014, the environment for low-cost carriers wasn't quite the same,\" Chen said, JJThere weren't so many brands in the market then.\n",
      "\n",
      "    So the industry has changed a lot.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    V Air's combined total of more than 530,000 passengers could not earn the airline enough to stay in business, analysts believe. Other budget airlines, such as the Singapore joint venture Tigerair Taiwan, have cut into its business. In May, eight Asian budget airlines formed a low-cost carrier alliance to add routes and step up passenger convenience, but V Air was not among them, V Air also relied heavily on secondary routes, which may lack infrastructure or passenger demand, said Eric Lin, Asia transport researcher with UBS Securities Asia. IJThe lack of scale is a problem for some of the startup airlines,\" Lin added, \"It's so capital intensive that you have to scale.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    The Taiwanese low-fare airline flew mainly to cities in Japan, which is dominated by traditional carriers, and in Southeast Asia where local budget carriers control much of the market, said Tina Chen, aviation analyst with SinoPac Securities in Taipei, V Air's closure effective 1 October follows a series of route cancellations, which the company may have hoped would keep it in business. The airline had planned in early 2015 to change its scheduled charter flights from Taipei to Siem Reap in Cambodia to regular service but called off the plan, In June this year it announced the cancellation of four flights per week from Taipei to Manila just months after starting it, In July the airline spiked its three weekly flights between Taipei and Macau.\n",
      "\n",
      "    But V Air routes from Taiwan to Bangkok and Chiang Mai were running at more than 77 percent capacity, TransAsia said, TransAsia will take over the V Air Chiang Mai route and another to Fukuoka, Japan.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Closures of budget airlines and absorption into bigger ones are hardly new to Asia, which has seen brisk growth in its low-cost market over the past decade. Long-haul carrier Oasis Hong Kong Airlines, for example, stopped flying in April 2008 after three years and in Japan, ANA took over the country's first budget carrier, Air Do in 2000, - RALPH JENNINGS\n",

      "\n",
      "    WHEN AIRASIA GROUP CHIEF EXECUTIVE Tony Femandes paid for a meal with Airbus chief operating officer for customers, John Leahy, in an Iranian restaurant in London last year, he was making a shrewd investment, It was the beginning of talks that led to the Malaysian low-cost carrier (LCC) confirming an order at July's Farnborough International for 100 Airbus A321neos for delivery from 2019, With the agreement making AirAsia the largest A320 Family customer (with 575 orders overall), the airline executive seems to have struck a good bargain. Celebrating the deal at Farnborough, Femandes thanked Leahy \"for giving me the aircraft\" The 236-passenger machines, which will be powered by CFM International Leap1A engines, are nominally worth US$12,6 billion at sticker prices.\n",
      "\n",
      "    The LCC is seeking opportunities throughout Asia, including China, says Femandes, \"If there's a chance to be in China, then 100 percent we will be there.\" He recognises that initial activity is likely tc involve joint venture (JV) operations with local interests. \"Obviously we are very keen to have a stake in China and to grow our own Chinese base. If that involves a joint venture that would be fantastic.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    Femandes says AirAsia is looking at developing services to currently unconnected secondary cities: IJNot Beijing or Shanghai, but new routes that will create new jobs [and] provide direct links tc Kuala Lumpur and Singapore,\" He has mandated the group's head of North Asia operations to establish business in China.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Acknowledging that any JV would probably involve a 25 percent stake for AirAsia, he claims that the group has been approached by Chinese parties. Legal protocols prevent him from providing details, but Femandes cites a Reuters report in early July that the group was approaching the establishment of a Chinese JV under plans to become a more extensive pan-Asian player, AirAsia responded formally by saying that it was not \"currently\" pursuing any new JV proposals, But the entrepreneur's ambitions are not limited to China: \"We look at [all of] Asia, wherever governments will welcome us.\" Fernandes says that the region's governments IJare beginning to understand low-cost carriers and to build LCC airports in Malaysia, Thailand and, now, India.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "    He sees India as an \"amazing market\" offering \"massive potential\" for tourism, He does not quantify how many aircraft could be supported for low-cost operations in the subcontinent, but describes AirAsia as already being \"very strong in the south\" \"What we are good at is providing connectivity where there's a need,\" proclaims Femandes, who remains frustrated that South Korea does not welcome AirAsia. \"[South] Korea exports all over the world, but if Malaysian carriers cannot operate [in the country] that is not fair [to local citizens],\" Femandes acknowledges the challenge LCCs face in obtaining the right balance and package of runway slots to support proposed new operations. \"Everywhere in Asia, LCCs have exploded growth, whether Indonesia, China, or Hong Kong,\" The official also reiterates his conservative approach to growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "    \"This won't be done overnight: we've [taken] a punt on a [larger] aircraft,\" says Femandes, who predicts that it could take more than five years for airports in Asia to \"catch up\" in providing appropriate infrastructure, Fleetwise, he says that AirAsia wants to \"maximise our slots; the A321neo provides another step forward\" and offers a \"bit more range: there's not an aircraft in town that can match [its operating] cost'.'While it was not clear if any of the 100 A321neos will be substituted for previously ordered A320neos, Femandes says Airbus was \"very helpful\" and had \"not been shoving aircraft down our throats'.' Accordingly, despite the big increase in AirAsia's order backlog at Airbus, the executive confirms that in 2017 the LCC would be \"going back to our usual growth of about 15 aircraft per year1; while he concedes that as many as 30 might be taken in some years, evidently being offset by some withdrawn capacity, +\n",

The region in the heel of the Italian boot has always been popular with Italians looking for a holiday by the beach, but now the rest of the world is catching on to its charms with people calling it \"the new Tuscany\" or \"the new Amalfi coast\". I was fortunate enough to visit this charming part of Italy earlier this year and I'll be perfectly honest with you: it's neither of those things.\n",

      "    If you've ever driven through Tuscany, you'll know that around every bend in the highway is another spectacular postcard-worthy view.

      "    To get to Puglia my partner and I drove across the country from Naples. According to Google Maps it should have taken us four hours but just by keeping up with the Italian traffic we managed to get it down to three. As we neared our destination in Puglia and regained our composure, we started to wonder what on earth we were doing there. Fr0m the highway it's not what you'd call picturesque. The beauty in Puglia, which is actually quite an expansive region, is hidden and you have to go and look for it - like the beach Polignano a Mare, pictured above.\n",
      "\n",

      "After years of focusing exclusively on its direct-to-consumer operations, enforcing strict fare and check-in procedures and eschewing the travel agency distribution channel, Jetstar has begun to reveal a new, softer side. Attendees at last month's CAPA Centre for Aviation conference were intrigued at the rhetoric in a keynote address by Jetstar chief executive officer Jayne Hrdlicka, who hinted strongly at an imminent push into the corporate market. She admitted the airline had not been good at catering to the flexibility required by business travellers, adding: \"We're working closely with Qantas to change that\".\n",

In the absence of further details, it's expected this will involve a range of new flexible fare options, perhaps with the ability to earn Qantas points, change and cancel flights and retain the value of unused tickets for future use. Such a move will be welcomed by travel management companies and businesses alike, particularly given that a significant amount of corporate traffic continues to use leisure-focused routes only served by Jetstar.\n",

Innovations include a new travel agent support hub and - shock horror - \"remunerable gross fares\" under which agencies will receive payments for fares sold via the Jetstar Agent Hub and the airline's direct-connect API. The carrier hasn't gone all the way - yet - with no agent payment for GDS bookings. But for those who purchase with the carrier agents receive $10 for domestic short-haul bookings, or $25 for international long-haul widebody services.\n",

She remained coy, but clearly this is an area where the much-touted Qantas Group 'two-brand strategy' can add significant value. However given Jetstar's longstanding animosity to travel agents - particularly when it was led by now Qantas ceo Alan Joyce - it remains to be seen whether the newfound affection results in a long-term romance, or ends up being more like a one night stand.\n",

      "WORDS BYRON MATHIOUDAKIS To truly compete with the Germans, Volvo needed a panacea. Its all-new S90 sedan and V90 wagon may just be that car ECENTLY a car company boss confirmed what many have long suspected... that respectability only comes when \"y? u get your 5 Series rival right\".\n",
      "\n",
      "    That's why Jaguar became relevant again only after the XF surfaced in 2007, Hyundai chose the G80 to go global with Genesis, and now social-climbing Volvo is targeting the BMW with its new S90 (and V90 wagon sibling due mid-2017). Like making it in New York, succeeding in the large luxury class is the Swedish brand's ticket to premium legitimacy.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Sharing 40 percent of parts with the XC90 launched last year, the S90 actually drove initial development of Volvo's all-new Scalable Product Architecture when work commenced during the dying days of Ford control in 2008. \"Sedan buyers are very fussy, so we had to get its proportions exactly right first,\" says program director Kent Falck.\n",
      "\n",
      "    SPA is essentially a set of electrificationready components based around a fixed \"wheel to heel\" front-end structure, with everything else attached being flexible longitudinally and vertically.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Even Volvo admits that outside Sweden nobody was exactly clamouring for S80 and V70 replacements, so the S90 and V90 couldn't just be BMW clones. They needed to be genuinely compelling. Longer, wider and lower than most rivals, the 54X project was benchmarked against \"basically the Germans\".\n",
      "\n",
      "    Formidable opponents, but Volvo reckons it's pushing boundaries. Though the S90 adopts the latest XC90's safety systems, it debuts: 'Run-Off Road Mitigation' that senses the edge of the road as well as painted lines to help reign in a straying vehicle; 'City Safety Large Animal Detection' (specifically for identifying and avoiding moose); and 'Pilot Assist' - semi-autonomous radar-controlled acceleration, braking and steering at speeds up to 130km/h. The big Volvo also continues the brand's 2.0-litre four-cylinder powertrain strategy, from the entry-level 187kW/350Nm T5 front-driver to the T8 AWD petrolelectric plug-in hybrid (with about 407kW/640Nm) arriving in 2017. It's all a tight fit, but the downsized engine policy has allowed the luxury of a doublewishbone front-end. As a result, it's unlikely we'll ever see sixes or a bent-eight shoved underneath the bonnet.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Only the higher-end T6 petrol (235kW/400Nm) and D5 diesel (173kW/480Nm) were available for trial at the S90's international launch in Spain, powering all four wheels (a part-time Haldex system) via a conventional eight-speed torque-converter auto also found in the T5 petrol and 140kW/400Nm D4 diesel front-drivers.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Almost in defiance of its 1969cc capacity, the T6 AWD is no slouch, leaping into action and maintaining a cracking pace as long as you don't spare the throttle. Power tops out at a fairly high 5700rpm, but there's little need to hear the four-pot turbo shriek since there's a sizeable wad of torque and smartly spaced gear ratios to keep things humming along sweetly.\n",

      "    Using a space-saving integral axle and transverse leaf-spring rear suspension design results in more cabin space, as well as a lower and wider cargo floor for greater practicality.

      "    As with the XC90, Drive Select offers overly light and softly suspended Eco and Comfort modes, but in the pitch-perfect Dynamic setting the whole car gels terrifically. Thank the optional 20-inch rubber, lower centre of gravity or reduced mass, but poise and response are the happy by-products.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Turn-in is instant and linear, the handling receptive, the chassis planted. Even the wagon version shrinks around you blasting along a tight and twisting road. Optional air-sprung rear suspension eliminates the V90's transverse leaf spring for a supple and isolated ride, further boosting our admiration.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Neither model is actually sporty, but there's a newfound athleticism that keen drivers can work with. Volvo calls it \"relaxed confidence\". Let's hope such comfort and control translates to Australian roads.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Inscription spec equals interior sumptuousness, meaning the S90's hushed cabin (thanks to optional double-glazing on our test vehicles) is more than a match for most rivals. The lack of wind and tyre roar was quite remarkable over the Spanish roads sampled.\n",
      "\n",
      "    Similar but better resolved than the XC90's interior, the lush leather, walnut, brushed aluminium and chrome meld seamlessly with the tech-heavy (and initially intimidating until familiarisation sets in) multiscreen displays, gorgeous instruments, lavish seating front and rear, and detailing exquisite enough to worry Audi. A big audio volume knob is such a luxury nowadays. This thing reeks of opulence.\n",

In May, eight Asian budget airlines formed a low-cost carrier alliance to add routes and step up passenger convenience, but V Air was not among them, V Air also relied heavily on secondary routes, which may lack infrastructure or passenger demand, said Eric Lin, Asia transport researcher with UBS Securities Asia.

The airline had planned in early 2015 to change its scheduled charter flights from Taipei to Siem Reap in Cambodia to regular service but called off the plan, In June this year it announced the cancellation of four flights per week from Taipei to Manila just months after starting it, In July the airline spiked its three weekly flights between Taipei and Macau.\\n\\n    But V Air routes from Taiwan to Bangkok and Chiang Mai were running at more than 77 percent capacity, TransAsia said, TransAsia will take over the V Air Chiang Mai route and another to Fukuoka, Japan.\\n\\n    Closures of budget airlines and absorption into bigger ones are hardly new to Asia, which has seen brisk growth in its low-cost market over the past decade.

According to Google Maps it should have taken us four hours but just by keeping up with the Italian traffic we managed to get it down to three. As we neared our destination in Puglia and regained our composure, we started to wonder what on earth we were doing there. Fr0m the highway it\\'s not what you\\'d call picturesque. The beauty in Puglia, which is actually quite an expansive region, is hidden and you have to go and look for it - like the beach Polignano a Mare, pictured above.\\n\\n    One of the most charming aspects of Puglia apart from the food of the region - is the type of hotel accommodation here. It\\'s a region that has more or less pioneered the concept of the masseria, or farm, hotel.\\n\\n    Many of them are still working farms and, therefore, a great place to stay if you\\'re after a culinary experience as well as a relaxing holiday near the coast. You can read more about Puglia in our story on page 74.\\n\\n    This is actually the fourth Italian themed edition we\\'ve done in nearly 11 years of publishing. Each time we go back there we find new and interesting businesses, people and places to profile. In this issue writer Jonathan Lobban meets with the king of cashmere Brunello Cucinelli, discovers the unique history of the Acqua di Parma fragrance company on its 100th anniversary, and gets a preview of a collection of Bulgari jewellery ahead of its showing at the National Gallery of Victoria later this month.\\n\\n    Our Italian-based writer Josephine McKenna met with the creative team behind the women\\'s fashion company Max Mara, discovered the Caruso menswear brand and looked into the shake-up happening in some of Italy\\'s major museums.\\n\\n    We also take a drive in a Ferrari 488 Spider on the Circuito del Mugello, a 66km stretch of road between Bologna and Florence that was once the route of one of Italy\\'s most importrant road races. Then for something a little less racy, but no less sporty, we look at the new Maserati Levante - the company\\'s first SUV. In fact everything in this edition, from our food and wine pages to our grooming and watch sections, has an Italian theme.\\n\\n    A big thank you to Etihad Airways for getting us to Italy in style and for Leading Hotels of the World for their wonderful hospitality.\\n\\n    A presto!\\n\\n    On the cover Photographer James Cant Stylist Ken Thompson Makeup Arianna Cattarin Hair James Pearce Christian Dior graphic floral polyamide/elastane mix trouser suit and leather pumps; Tiffany & Co.

Like making it in New York, succeeding in the large luxury class is the Swedish brand\\'s ticket to premium legitimacy.\\n\\n    Sharing 40 percent of parts with the XC90 launched last year, the S90 actually drove initial development of Volvo\\'s all-new Scalable Product Architecture when work commenced during the dying days of Ford control in 2008. \"Sedan buyers are very fussy, so we had to get its proportions exactly right first,\" says program director Kent Falck.\\n\\n    SPA is essentially a set of electrificationready components based around a fixed \"wheel to heel\" front-end structure, with everything else attached being flexible longitudinally and vertically.\\n\\n    Even Volvo admits that outside Sweden nobody was exactly clamouring for S80 and V70 replacements, so the S90 and V90 couldn\\'t just be BMW clones. They needed to be genuinely compelling. Longer, wider and lower than most rivals, the 54X project was benchmarked against \"basically the Germans\".\\n\\n    Formidable opponents, but Volvo reckons it\\'s pushing boundaries. Though the S90 adopts the latest XC90\\'s safety systems, it debuts: \\'Run-Off Road Mitigation\\' that senses the edge of the road as well as painted lines to help reign in a straying vehicle; \\'City Safety Large Animal Detection\\' (specifically for identifying and avoiding moose); and \\'Pilot Assist\\' - semi-autonomous radar-controlled acceleration, braking and steering at speeds up to 130km/h. The big Volvo also continues the brand\\'s 2.0-litre four-cylinder powertrain strategy, from the entry-level 187kW/350Nm T5 front-driver to the T8 AWD petrolelectric plug-in hybrid (with about 407kW/640Nm) arriving in 2017. It\\'s all a tight fit, but the downsized engine policy has allowed the luxury of a doublewishbone front-end. As a result, it\\'s unlikely we\\'ll ever see sixes or a bent-eight shoved underneath the bonnet.\\n\\n    Only the higher-end T6 petrol (235kW/400Nm) and D5 diesel (173kW/480Nm) were available for trial at the S90\\'s international launch in Spain, powering all four wheels (a part-time Haldex system) via a conventional eight-speed torque-converter auto also found in the T5 petrol and 140kW/400Nm D4 diesel front-drivers.\\n\\n    Almost in defiance of its 1969cc capacity, the T6 AWD is no slouch, leaping into action and maintaining a cracking pace as long as you don\\'t spare the throttle. Power tops out at a fairly high 5700rpm, but there\\'s little need to hear the four-pot turbo shriek since there\\'s a sizeable wad of torque and smartly spaced gear ratios to keep things humming along sweetly.\\n\\n    However, the auto\\'s occasional jerky downshifts, propensity to not upshift until the engine is screaming in Dynamic, and lack of steering-wheel paddles sully an otherwise slick mechanical ensemble.\\n\\n    The brawny D5 AWD is what really - and literally - blows expectations clean away, thanks to Volvo\\'s PowerPulse system. Conceived in just 18 months, it uses compressed air to multiply turbine speeds, slashing turbo lag for a strong and stirring stream of performance, without the off-boost blues to impede SUCCEEDING IN THE LARGE LUXURY CLASS IS THE\\n\\n    SWEDISH BRAND\\'S TICKET TO PREMIUM LEGITIMACY\\n\\n    STICKING TO\\n\\n    THEIR GUNS The S90\\'s unusual tail-light design and bumper-level numberplate housing are designed to convey width and a \\'muscular arms\\' stance.\\n\\n    Volvo went with them because they make a statement, even though they proved controversial in styling clinics. \"Nobody liked them, but we did it anyway,\" said project boss Kent Falck.\\n\\n    The signature LED headlight strip is said to evoke Thor\\'s hammer, while more Norse mythology can be found in the grille, which possesses Volvo\\'s long-lived shield-and-sash motif.\\n\\n    MINDING YOUR\\n\\n    P1800 CUES The S90\\'s rakish silhouette, concave grille and \\'VOLVO\\' lettering (originally proposed with night-time downlighting until regs scuppered the idea) were inspired by a P1800 coupe parked in the Gothenburg studio. Other influences include the ultra-short front overhang, cab-backward and extended dash-to-axle ratio proportions; all said to impart a premium feel - vital in its three key markets: the US, China and Korea.\\n\\n    108 WheefeMag.com.au OUT\\n\\n    THE BOX The wagon\\'s sloping rear rejects the look of boxy Volvo wagons of old (and of Swedish tastes) in order to lure more global buyers. In Europe the V90 is expected to account for some 70 percent of total model sales.\\n\\n    Using a space-saving integral axle and transverse leaf-spring rear suspension design results in more cabin space, as well as a lower and wider cargo floor for greater practicality. Plus, an extended rear compared to the preceding V70 means the V90\\'s luggage volume total is only 15 litres shy at 575 litres.\\n\\n    And no rear-facing kid seats?\\n\\n    \"We love them, but they\\'re not perceived as premium enough,\" explained Volvo safety guru Lottajakobsson.\\n\\n    progress. A neat 7.0sec to lOOkm/h isn\\'t too shabby. Other models are slated for this tech in the near future, including the new GEP3-series 1.5-litre three-pot turbo-petrol in next year\\'s 40 Series hatch.\\n\\n    Better still, the more powerful of the twin-turbo diesel offerings is barely any less economical on the EU combined cycle, averaging 4.8L/100km, which is astonishing for a full-size five-seat luxury car.\\n\\n    But the biggest shock is how the S90 T6 has discovered levels of steering feel and feedback foreign to any previous large Volvo.\\n\\n    As with the XC90, Drive Select offers overly light and softly suspended Eco and Comfort modes, but in the pitch-perfect Dynamic setting the whole car gels terrifically. Thank the optional 20-inch rubber, lower centre of gravity or reduced mass, but poise and response are the happy by-products.\\n\\n    Turn-in is instant and linear, the handling receptive, the chassis planted. Even the wagon version shrinks around you blasting along a tight and twisting road. Optional air-sprung rear suspension eliminates the V90\\'s transverse leaf spring for a supple and isolated ride, further boosting our admiration.\\n\\n    Neither model is actually sporty, but there\\'s a newfound athleticism that keen drivers can work with. Volvo calls it \"relaxed confidence\". Let\\'s hope such comfort and control translates to Australian roads.\\n\\n    Inscription spec equals interior sumptuousness, meaning the S90\\'s hushed cabin (thanks to optional double-glazing on our test vehicles) is more than a match for most rivals. The lack of wind and tyre roar was quite remarkable over the Spanish roads sampled.\\n\\n    Similar but better resolved than the XC90\\'s interior, the lush leather, walnut, brushed aluminium and chrome meld seamlessly with the tech-heavy (and initially intimidating until familiarisation sets in) multiscreen displays, gorgeous instruments, lavish seating front and rear, and detailing exquisite enough to worry Audi. A big audio volume knob is such a luxury nowadays. This thing reeks of opulence.\\n\\n    At nearly five metres long, the S90 comfortably accommodates five six-footers, despite the sloping roofline, while cargo volume - including underfloor storage - is on a par with a Commodore\\'s at 500 litres (only 60 litres less than the almost-as-swoopy wagon).\\n\\n    \"In Sweden, people wanted square wagons like the old 700 Series just in case they needed to buy a washing machine.\" Falck said. \"And that was probably once every 20 years.\" Seems the days of the boxy Volvo estate are gone.\\n\\n    Sore points include the $3K Tech Pack gouge that includes the distractingly awkward Drive Mode switch, gimmicky engine-start dial, digital radio (it should be standard), surround-view reversing system, head-up display and Apple CarPlay/Android Auto.\\n\\n    The $79,900 S90 T5 Momentum includes adaptive cruise, lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring, reversing camera, automatic parking, leather, four-zone climate control, keyless start, electric front seats with memory, electric bootlid, and LED headlights with bending tech.\\n\\n    Inscription in the D5 AWD ups the ante with more performance and grip, 19-inch alloys (up from the base 18s), Nappa leather and ambient lighting. The T6 equivalent adds another $2K.\\n\\n    Expensive for a Ford-era Volvo perhaps, but the Geely-funded S90 might have just made it as a blinding BMW 5 Series botherer.

How successfully\\n\\n    the group can implement the plan\\n\\n    remains in question. AAV editor\\n\\n    Matt Driskill explains.\\n\\n    AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING and more recently lots of political\\n\\n    wrangling, ASEAN\\'s Open Skies policy agreement was finally concluded\\n\\n    by all 10 members of the bloc in April this year sort of. Like\\n\\n    China\\'s brand of capitalism with Chinese characteristics, ASEAN\\'s\\n\\n    brand of open skies means members of the bloc will be able to fly into each others\\' capitals, but some countries, like Indonesia, Laos\\n\\n    and the Philippines, have put restrictions in place that will limit\\n\\n    access to specific areas and airports, The Philippines has also said\\n\\n    Manila is off-limits to its fellow ASEAN members,\\n\\n    Those limits, and ASEAN\\'s built-in foundational weakness as an\\n\\n    association with no enforcement mechanism to make members obey\\n\\n    the rules, means ASEAN may never have a truly full and complete\\n\\n    Open Skies pact like that in Europe or the United States.\\n\\n    Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association of Asia\\n\\n    Pacific Airlines (AAPA), said in March that the \"problem with ASEAN\\n\\n    is that it\\'s not a top-down organisation but built on consenses..,so\\n\\n    the pace of implementation varies and you\\'ve got some countries\\n\\n    that are slower than others.\"\\n\\n    The bloc is made up of Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,\\n\\n    Cambodia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore,\\n\\n    All of these nations are home to low-cost carriers (LCCs) and\\n\\n    some well-recognised brand name full-service carriers, None of the\\n\\n    nations want to see their respective market share diminished by\\n\\n    fellow ASEAN members.\\n\\n    Citing concerns about congestion and admitting that competition\\n\\n    concerns were also in play, Indonesia limited access to five airports,\\n\\n    Laos to two airports and the Philippines said its main airport in\\n\\n    Manila couldn\\'t handle any increase in traffic that a true Open Skies\\n\\n    policy would bring. In addition, agreement on the so-called \"7th\\n\\n    freedom traffic rights,\" which would allow carriers the right to carry\\n\\n    passengers and cargo between two foreign countries without any\\n\\n    continuing service to one\\'s own country, remains an open issue.\\n\\n    Despite these shortcomings in the ASEAN agreement, the bloc\\n\\n    itself says it is now in a position to cut deals with the United States,\\n\\n    the European Union, India, China, Japan and Russia and perhaps\\n\\n    the UK now that that country has voted to leave the EU,\\n\\n    IJUnder these agreements, there will be greater regional and domestic\\n\\n    air transport connectivity, which will facilitate greater growth\\n\\n    of the aviation industry, the tourism sector, as well as of the whole\\n\\n    regional economy,\" ASEAN says in its official Open Skies policy documents.\\n\\n    \"ASEAN member states are working toward advancing safer\\n\\n    and more secure skies, enhancing traffic management efficiency\\n\\n    and capacity through a seamless ASEAN sky, and fostering greater\\n\\n    air connectivity including the conclusion of aviation agreements\\n\\n    with dialogue partners, All of these will contribute toward deeper\\n\\n    ASEAN integration, as it enters the next phase of consolidation as\\n\\n    a dynamic and open ASEAN Community,\"\\n\\n    In addition to limits placed on some access points by member states, several ASEAN countries fall short\\n\\n    of meeting all the rules and regulations put\\n\\n    in place by the International Civil Aviation\\n\\n    Organisation (ICAO). Indonesia and Thailand\\n\\n    are two that come to mind and several others\\n\\n    are falling short of requirements put in\\n\\n    place by regions like the US and EU,\\n\\n    Wolfgang Sander-Fischer, an international\\n\\n    aviation consultant, told AAV in an interview\\n\\n    that ASEAN will at some point include the\\n\\n    7th freedom rights and said while the current\\n\\n    state is not \"full liberalisation, this a further,\\n\\n    major goal that may reasonably be achieved\\n\\n    within the next five years if political will is exercised by all ASEAN member states and harmonisation efforts\\n\\n    are increased.\"\\n\\n    Sander-Fischer also said ASEAN restrictions in places like Manila\\n\\n    and Indonesia and restrictions in air traffic management \"need to be\\n\\n    alleviated as soon as possible\" and agreed that ASEAN members\\n\\n    \"need to increase their investments to alleviate aviation infrastructure\\n\\n    bottlenecks if they wish to accommodate the anticipated increase in\\n\\n    regional and domestic airtransport.\"\\n\\n    IJAII airlines based in ASEAN are set to benefit from liberalisation of\\n\\n    aviation in ASEAN as these may utilise many new routings that are\\n\\n    being opened up. To reap full benefits, however, adaptive business\\n\\n    models will likely do better than traditional ones and enhanced collaboration\\n\\n    among airlines will be beneficial,\" Sander-Fischer told AAV,\\n\\n    Winners & Losers\\n\\n    There will be some winners as ASEAN implements the Open Skies\\n\\n    policy, LCCs and makers of smaller aircraft are expected to benefit\\n\\n    from the plan and regions like Singapore could also benefit because\\n\\n    the city-state has an established baseinChangi International Airport\\n\\n    that also has a well formulated growth plan in place that will allow\\n\\n    it to increase its capacity. The benefit for LCCs is that many of the region\\'s top destinations are no more than two hours apart, which\\n\\n    is the sweet-spot for low-cost carriers.\\n\\n    Malaysia\\'s AirAsia, Indonesia\\'s Lion Air, and Philippine carrier\\n\\n    Cebu Pacific, all plan to expand their operations with AirAsia saying\\n\\n    it wants to develop more traffic to the Philippines and Indonesia,\\n\\n    Full-service airlines like Thai Airways, Garuda Indonesia and Philippine\\n\\n    Airlines are planning to use their long-haul network to connect\\n\\n    passengers to their Southeast Asia services,\\n\\n    Manufacturers of regional aircraft in the 70 to 130-seat range like\\n\\n    Brazil\\'s Embraer, Canada\\'s Bombardier and ATRf a joint venture between\\n\\n    Airbus and Italy\\'s Finmeccanica, are also expected to benefit\\n\\n    since those aircraft can serve shorter regional routes for much less\\n\\n    per seat than Airbus or Boeing jets.\\n\\n    Probably the biggest challenge to fully implementing a real and lasting\\n\\n    Open Skies policy is that Southeast Asia\\'s infrastructure is woefully\\n\\n    lacking. Many airports across the region are operating above their design capacities as any seasoned traveller\\n\\n    can attest to, leading to long check-in lines,\\n\\n    delays, and overcrowded skies,\\n\\n    Bangkok\\'s Suvarnabhumi Airport, Manila\\'s\\n\\n    Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Jakarta\\'s\\n\\n    Soekarno-Hatta International Airport\\n\\n    have reached full capacity and the problems\\n\\n    are spilling over to smaller airports in those\\n\\n    same countries, Singapore\\'s Changi is probably\\n\\n    the exception to the rule in Southeast\\n\\n    Asia with three terminals that can handle 66\\n\\n    million passengers annually and two more\\n\\n    under construction.\\n\\n    Steve Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace,\\n\\n    Asia-Pacific, said recently that the downside of ASEAN\\'s Open\\n\\n    Skies policy is that the infrastructure isn\\'t ready for it yet. The region\\n\\n    lacks the runways and airport numbers to make it really take off and\\n\\n    falls short on the airside too with shortfalls in air traffic management,\\n\\n    Colin Mahoney, a senior vice president at Rockwell Collins, concurred,\\n\\n    saying that \"it is all about capacity management. So there\\n\\n    is no point having a frequency of flights with empty seats. You\\'ve\\n\\n    got to balance frequency with load factors. Load factors are going\\n\\n    to be key for any efficient operation.\"\\n\\n    Paul Nef, Honeywell Aerospace\\'s business development director\\n\\n    for Asia-Pacific, told /Wthat the ASEAN Open Skies policy, despite\\n\\n    its current shortcomings, will help spur growth and influence a more\\n\\n    competitive space by creating a single and unified air transport\\n\\n    market in the area,\\n\\n    \"The boom in air traffic creates challenges for the aviation industry.\\n\\n    Airports across the region are struggling to cope with the increasing\\n\\n    number of air travellers, especially as the growth in passenger\\n\\n    traffic outpaces that of airport infrastructure and facilities...While\\n\\n    countries across the region such as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam\\n\\n    are looking to expand their airports by building new terminals and\\n\\n    runways, ASEAN nations should look into equipping airports with\\n\\n    ..ASEAN nations should\\n\\n    look into equipping\\n\\n    airports with the right\\n\\n    technologies both on the\\n\\n    ground and in the air to\\n\\n    reap the most benefits\\n\\n    from the Open Skies policy.\\n\\n    PAUL NEF, HONEYWELL\\n\\n    the right technologies both on the ground and in the air to reap the\\n\\n    most benefits from the Open Skies policy,\" Nef said,\\n\\n    Nef also told AAV that ASEAN airports need to improve the flow\\n\\n    of aircraft arrivals and departures at major airports and that airports,\\n\\n    airlines and government authorities need to start exploring \"advanced\\n\\n    technologies they can leverage to cope with this challenge,\\n\\n    to meet future passenger demand as they expand their airports.\"\\n\\n    Nef said Honeywell\\'s SmartPath Ground-Based Augmentation\\n\\n    System for air traffic management \"can help solve critical needs\\n\\n    such as helping airports better manage air traffic and alleviating\\n\\n    the pressure on air traffic controllers, while existing expansion and\\n\\n    infrastructure upgrades take place at airports throughout the region,\"\\n\\n    Herdman, the AAPA director general, is also concerned about the\\n\\n    infrastructure shortfalls in the ASEAN region, Herdman says that\\n\\n    while the agreement is a positive overall for the region, \"the growth in air traffic has often exceeded national expectations, and with\\n\\n    limited airport runway and terminal capacity at many key airports\\n\\n    across the region, has led to congestion and scarcity of takeoff and\\n\\n    landing slots at peak times of the day,\"\\n\\n    \"Industry is a willing partner, but governments have an important\\n\\n    role to play in master planning and coordinating the necessary investments\\n\\n    in associated aviation infrastructure, including airports\\n\\n    and air navigation services, to keep pace with the projected growth\\n\\n    in travel and tourism demand. Recruitment and training of skilled\\n\\n    personnel, including pilots and technicians, is another ongoing\\n\\n    challenge,\" Herdman told AAV.\\n\\n    Herdman also told AAV that ASEAN\\'s Open Skies agreement\\n\\n    could have a role to play in raising the safety standards of airlines\\n\\n    and airports in the region,\\n\\n    \"The ASEAN Open Skies policy is focused on air services liberalisation,\\n\\n    so does not directly address safety related issues. However, there\\n\\n    have been some suggestions that, in the longer term, ASEAN could\\n\\n    also play a role in encouraging harmonisation of national licensing\\n\\n    regimes and other technical standards within the region, ICAO itself\\n\\n    is also actively engaged in a global effort to raise compliance and\\n\\n    implementation standards across the world through its \\'No Country\\n\\n    Left Behind\\' programme with similar objectives,\" Herdman said.\\n\\n    The ASEAN Open Skies agreement is expected to be a boon for\\n\\n    manufacturers, especially makers of smaller regional jets like Embraer\\n\\n    and in some countries for makers of turboprops.\\n\\n    Embraer\\'s vice president for Asia-Pacific, Mark Dunnachie, told\\n\\n    AAV in a phone interview from Farnborough that \"from our perspective\\n\\n    we\\'d like to see it (Open Skies) go a lot faster and everyone with\\n\\n    a stake in it would like to see that, but anything that takes us in a\\n\\n    direction we want to go is a good course,\" he said,\\n\\n    \"We\\'re strong advocates of pushing this, but we also believe it\\'s a\\n\\n    matter of the region right-sizing the aircraft,\" he added, referring to\\n\\n    the fact that the majority of routes in Southeast Asia are less than\\n\\n    two hours flight time with smaller passenger loads and \"we don\\'t\\n\\n    think it\\'s smart to fly the wrong kind of capacity. The legacy carriers\\n\\n    cannot continue with the current model If you\\'re not making money\\n\\n    today, you\\'ll never make money. There\\'s been too much focus on the\\n\\n    seat-mile cost and we\\'re trying to balance that with the trip cost,\"\\n\\n    Dunnachie also said some Southeast Asian countries may be\\n\\n    going down the wrong road in developing mega hub airports and\\n\\n    instead should focus on increasing the number of flights and moving\\n\\n    passengers more easily and fluidly in and out of the airport.\\n\\n    \"If you put Jakarta or Manila alongside Atlanta or Phoenix, the air\\n\\n    space is not being optimised. We need to be able to exit the airspace\\n\\n    quicker and there\\'s scope to get more movements per hour out of\\n\\n    that,\" Dunnachie said, \"Don\\'t give me a shopping mail. Give me\\n\\n    something I can get into and out of quickly, We don\\'t need complex\\n\\n    handling in regional aviation. We need air stairs, quick turnarounds.,.1\\n\\n    would applaud initiatives by India, Indonesia and the Philippines,\\n\\n    but let\\'s not wait too long for something to be built when we could\\n\\n    refine what we have.\" + ICAO SCORES BELOW PAR\\n\\n    FOR MANY ASEAN MEMBERS\\n\\n    With the explosive growth in Asian aviation generally and that of lowcost\\n\\n    carriers in Southeast Asia in particular, many are asking if it\\'s too\\n\\n    much, too fast.
