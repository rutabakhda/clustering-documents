According to Google Maps it should have taken us four hours but just by keeping up with the Italian traffic we managed to get it down to three. As we neared our destination in Puglia and regained our composure, we started to wonder what on earth we were doing there. Fr0m the highway it's not what you'd call picturesque. The beauty in Puglia, which is actually quite an expansive region, is hidden and you have to go and look for it - like the beach Polignano a Mare, pictured above.\n\n    One of the most charming aspects of Puglia apart from the food of the region - is the type of hotel accommodation here. It's a region that has more or less pioneered the concept of the masseria, or farm, hotel.\n\n    Many of them are still working farms and, therefore, a great place to stay if you're after a culinary experience as well as a relaxing holiday near the coast. You can read more about Puglia in our story on page 74.\n\n    This is actually the fourth Italian themed edition we've done in nearly 11 years of publishing. Each time we go back there we find new and interesting businesses, people and places to profile. In this issue writer Jonathan Lobban meets with the king of cashmere Brunello Cucinelli, discovers the unique history of the Acqua di Parma fragrance company on its 100th anniversary, and gets a preview of a collection of Bulgari jewellery ahead of its showing at the National Gallery of Victoria later this month.\n\n    Our Italian-based writer Josephine McKenna met with the creative team behind the women's fashion company Max Mara, discovered the Caruso menswear brand and looked into the shake-up happening in some of Italy's major museums.\n\n    We also take a drive in a Ferrari 488 Spider on the Circuito del Mugello, a 66km stretch of road between Bologna and Florence that was once the route of one of Italy's most importrant road races. Then for something a little less racy, but no less sporty, we look at the new Maserati Levante - the company's first SUV.

But a petty playground squabble this was not.\n\n    This was the end of a rather undignified, tatty and very public four-year spat between Australia's national flag carrier and the country's peak tourism agency.\n\n    That someone thought it time to bang the collective heads together of Qantas and Tourism Australia is to be welcomed.

Its all-new S90 sedan and V90 wagon may just be that car ECENTLY a car company boss confirmed what many have long suspected... that respectability only comes when \"y? u get your 5 Series rival right\".\n\n    That's why Jaguar became relevant again only after the XF surfaced in 2007, Hyundai chose the G80 to go global with Genesis, and now social-climbing Volvo is targeting the BMW with its new S90 (and V90 wagon sibling due mid-2017). Like making it in New York, succeeding in the large luxury class is the Swedish brand's ticket to premium legitimacy.\n\n    Sharing 40 percent of parts with the XC90 launched last year, the S90 actually drove initial development of Volvo's all-new Scalable Product Architecture when work commenced during the dying days of Ford control in 2008. \"Sedan buyers are very fussy, so we had to get its proportions exactly right first,\" says program director Kent Falck.\n\n    SPA is essentially a set of electrificationready components based around a fixed \"wheel to heel\" front-end structure, with everything else attached being flexible longitudinally and vertically.\n\n    Even Volvo admits that outside Sweden nobody was exactly clamouring for S80 and V70 replacements, so the S90 and V90 couldn't just be BMW clones. They needed to be genuinely compelling. Longer, wider and lower than most rivals, the 54X project was benchmarked against \"basically the Germans\".\n\n    Formidable opponents, but Volvo reckons it's pushing boundaries. Though the S90 adopts the latest XC90's safety systems, it debuts: 'Run-Off Road Mitigation' that senses the edge of the road as well as painted lines to help reign in a straying vehicle; 'City Safety Large Animal Detection' (specifically for identifying and avoiding moose); and 'Pilot Assist' - semi-autonomous radar-controlled acceleration, braking and steering at speeds up to 130km/h. The big Volvo also continues the brand's 2.0-litre four-cylinder powertrain strategy, from the entry-level 187kW/350Nm T5 front-driver to the T8 AWD petrolelectric plug-in hybrid (with about 407kW/640Nm) arriving in 2017. It's all a tight fit, but the downsized engine policy has allowed the luxury of a doublewishbone front-end.

"fulltext": "\r\n    WORDS BYRON MATHIOUDAKIS To truly compete with the Germans, Volvo needed a panacea. Its all-new S90 sedan and V90 wagon may just be that car ECENTLY a car company boss confirmed what many have long suspected... that respectability only comes when \"y? u get your 5 Series rival right\".\r\n\r\n    That's why Jaguar became relevant again only after the XF surfaced in 2007, Hyundai chose the G80 to go global with Genesis, and now social-climbing Volvo is targeting the BMW with its new S90 (and V90 wagon sibling due mid-2017). Like making it in New York, succeeding in the large luxury class is the Swedish brand's ticket to premium legitimacy.\r\n\r\n    Sharing 40 percent of parts with the XC90 launched last year, the S90 actually drove initial development of Volvo's all-new Scalable Product Architecture when work commenced during the dying days of Ford control in 2008. \"Sedan buyers are very fussy, so we had to get its proportions exactly right first,\" says program director Kent Falck.\r\n\r\n    SPA is essentially a set of electrificationready components based around a fixed \"wheel to heel\" front-end structure, with everything else attached being flexible longitudinally and vertically.\r\n\r\n    Even Volvo admits that outside Sweden nobody was exactly clamouring for S80 and V70 replacements, so the S90 and V90 couldn't just be BMW clones. They needed to be genuinely compelling. Longer, wider and lower than most rivals, the 54X project was benchmarked against \"basically the Germans\".\r\n\r\n    Formidable opponents, but Volvo reckons it's pushing boundaries. Though the S90 adopts the latest XC90's safety systems, it debuts: 'Run-Off Road Mitigation' that senses the edge of the road as well as painted lines to help reign in a straying vehicle; 'City Safety Large Animal Detection' (specifically for identifying and avoiding moose); and 'Pilot Assist' - semi-autonomous radar-controlled acceleration, braking and steering at speeds up to 130km/h. The big Volvo also continues the brand's 2.0-litre four-cylinder powertrain strategy, from the entry-level 187kW/350Nm T5 front-driver to the T8 AWD petrolelectric plug-in hybrid (with about 407kW/640Nm) arriving in 2017. It's all a tight fit, but the downsized engine policy has allowed the luxury of a doublewishbone front-end. As a result, it's unlikely we'll ever see sixes or a bent-eight shoved underneath the bonnet.\r\n\r\n    Only the higher-end T6 petrol (235kW/400Nm) and D5 diesel (173kW/480Nm) were available for trial at the S90's international launch in Spain, powering all four wheels (a part-time Haldex system) via a conventional eight-speed torque-converter auto also found in the T5 petrol and 140kW/400Nm D4 diesel front-drivers.\r\n\r\n    Almost in defiance of its 1969cc capacity, the T6 AWD is no slouch, leaping into action and maintaining a cracking pace as long as you don't spare the throttle.

And in today's EPL, Man U just can't boss the league the way it used to.\r\n\r\n    Top in England, behind only the Spanish giants.\r\n\r\n    And Deloitte says they'll be back to no.1 in 2017Zlatan Ibrahimovic.\r\n\r\n    Noting that Eric Cantona was \"King of Manchester\", Zlatan settled for wanting to become \"God of Manchester\".\r\n\r\n    Zlatan and Marcus Rashford develop buddy comedy-level chemistry.\r\n\r\n    Slumming it to fourth despite leading the EPL in goals.\r\n\r\n    Ilkay Gundogan, from Dortmund, who almost went to United.\r\n\r\n    No sideline figure in history is as stylish as Pep Guardiola.\r\n\r\n    Tyrell. Wealthy, powerful, yet forever obsessed with looking pretty.\r\n\r\n    The Barca brain trust is back together, with all hat Abu Dhabi cash o spend. Still kneedeep in talent, with he likes of Kevin de Bruyne.\r\n\r\n    Is Pep really a genius? Part of a system at Barca, unassailable at Bayern, he's now in a vastly more competitive league.\r\n\r\n    Sixth in Deloitte's ranking, but hardly matters. Got so much money, they signed a teen to play e-sports for them.\r\n\r\n    Yaya Toure, who played for Guardiola at Barcelona, is either going to be the symbol of the Citizens' resurgence ... or part of a generational turnover.\r\n\r\n    They'll win it?\r\n\r\n    Hardly a bold prediction, as City is a 2.5-to-i fave with the bookies.\r\n\r\n    Totally forgetting that Chelsea had won the league the year before.\r\n\r\n    Michy Batshuayi, a Belgian striker from Marseille.\r\n\r\n    Like Dimitri Payet! Antonio Conte is fiery. Once told his Juve goalie Gianluigi Buffon he was \"a defeat from the moment you open your mouth\".\r\n\r\n    Arryn.Well, maybe not, but Roman Abramovich is a lot like Littlefinger.\r\n\r\n    If they finish better than 10th, that's an improvement. They should finish better than 10th.\r\n\r\n    Ofthe new managers, Conte might need the most time to get the sort of players he wants. Or more accurately, get rid of those he doesn't.\r\n\r\n    The original big spenders of the EPL are only its fourth-richest club. Still better than 10th.\r\n\r\n    John Terry. Still there, still captain. Even agreed to take a pay cut... to 50,000 a week.\r\n\r\n    Mourinho will remain remarkably civil about Chelsea...\r\n\r\n    until they pose a threat to him.\r\n\r\n    In a season seemingly made for them to finally get back on top, they finished ten points back in second.\r\n\r\n    Granit Xhaka, Swiss Kosov; with a healt sense of optimism. Call Arsenal \"the best team in the world\".\r\n\r\n    Arsene Wenger.\r\n\r\n    ratheon, at least in terms of the level of infighting.\r\n\r\n    The Gunners will finish between second and fourth, as they do every The Gunners will finish between second and fourth, as they do every Here's one to appal the fans: Arsenal is 7th in the money league, with the highest matchdaytake.\r\n\r\n    MesutOzil.The German playmaker took to Instagram to plead with Wenger for a new striker this offseason.\r\n\r\n    Arsenal will finish lower than fourth.\r\n\r\n    But Wenger will keep his job.\r\n\r\n    A All in all, 201516 wasn't so bad: Europa runner-up, justice for Hillsborough, ejected Brendan Rodgers.\r\n\r\n    Shame they finished 8th.\r\n\r\n    Ragnar Klavan, an Estonian who seems destined to be the latest in the line of embattled Liverpool centre-backs.\r\n\r\n    Jurgen Klopp has a noted potty mouth.\r\n\r\n    Or is he just speaking German?\r\n\r\n    They used to be Stark, everyone's favourite northerners.\r\n\r\n    Except, of course, to Everton fans.\r\n\r\n    Klopp's distinctive pressing style, which showed impressive flashes last season, takes hold while the other big clubs sort themselves out.\r\n\r\n    The overall quality isn't quite there yet for a serious title challenge, with youngsters counted upon to play key roles.\r\n\r\n    Sign of the times: Liverpool was the ninth-richest in 2011, at S356m.\r\n\r\n    They made $69Om last year... and still rank ninth.\r\n\r\n    Steve Gerrard. e may be playing for the LA Galaxy, but it's still Steve Gerrard.\r\n\r\n    Liverpool will use its LeBron James hook-up to try to lure a transfer target. Brit press will respond: LeBron who?\r\n\r\n    enham Finally crashed Champs League again, and put an almighty scare into Arsenal.\r\n\r\n    Georges-Kevin N'Koudou, a team-mate of Batshuayi's at Marseille.\r\n\r\n    Mauricio Pochettino once made his players do a trust-building exercise where they had to push arrows with their throats.\r\n\r\n    Tully. One of the dull ones in the middle.\r\n\r\n    s Spurs'collection of young talent: Kane, Alii, Dier, Eriksen and Lamela are all under 25. Led EPL in goal difference.\r\n\r\n    Inability to get results is still a worry. How they'll manage their European campaign bears watching.\r\n\r\n    12th, but will become the sixth EPL club in the world's top ten once the windfall from Europe and TV kicks in.\r\n\r\n    Harry Kane. That you can go eight matches without scoring, then bag 25 to lead the league is pretty impressive.\r\n\r\n    Tottenham does well. And then its fans spend the season getting all nervous about Pochettino leaving for a big Spanish club.\r\n\r\n    Surprise run to 7th, closed the Boleyn Ground, and in classic Hammers' style, pelted the Man U team bus with bottles.\r\n\r\n    Havard Nordtveit, of Norway, and a former Arsenal prospect.\r\n\r\n    Slaven Bilic plays guitar in a rock band named Rawbau.\r\n\r\n    Like the Freys, they're an unfashionable bunch who cut a deal to get a new castle.\r\n\r\n    Dimitri Payet looks like he's staying.\r\n\r\n    And it's nice that the Olympic Stadium from the 2012 Games is being put to good use.\r\n\r\n    If they do have to sell Payet, it's a worry. This is a club that was defrauded in a Christmas hamper scam two years ago.\r\n\r\n    The 20th-richest club in the world, would you believe?\r\n\r\n    Two-thirds of their revenue comes from the EPL's TV deal.\r\n\r\n    Without knowing Payet's status, we're going to go with Mark Noble. Low-cost fave of EPL fantasy leaguers everywhere.\r\n\r\n    West Ham's captain had a terrific season last year.\r\n\r\n    With Aston Villa no longer in the top flight, casual viewers start confusing West Ham's strip with Burnley's.",

How successfully\n\n    the group can implement the plan\n\n    remains in question. AAV editor\n\n    Matt Driskill explains.\n\n    AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING and more recently lots of political\n\n    wrangling, ASEAN's Open Skies policy agreement was finally concluded\n\n    by all 10 members of the bloc in April this year sort of. Like\n\n    China's brand of capitalism with Chinese characteristics, ASEAN's\n\n    brand of open skies means members of the bloc will be able to fly into each others' capitals, but some countries, like Indonesia, Laos\n\n    and the Philippines, have put restrictions in place that will limit\n\n    access to specific areas and airports, The Philippines has also said\n\n    Manila is off-limits to its fellow ASEAN members,\n\n    Those limits, and ASEAN's built-in foundational weakness as an\n\n    association with no enforcement mechanism to make members obey\n\n    the rules, means ASEAN may never have a truly full and complete\n\n    Open Skies pact like that in Europe or the United States.\n\n    Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association of Asia\n\n    Pacific Airlines (AAPA), said in March that the \"problem with ASEAN\n\n    is that it's not a top-down organisation but built on consenses..,so\n\n    the pace of implementation varies and you've got some countries\n\n    that are slower than others.\"\n\n    The bloc is made up of Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,\n\n    Cambodia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore,\n\n    All of these nations are home to low-cost carriers (LCCs) and\n\n    some well-recognised brand name full-service carriers, None of the\n\n    nations want to see their respective market share diminished by\n\n    fellow ASEAN members.\n\n    Citing concerns about congestion and admitting that competition\n\n    concerns were also in play, Indonesia limited access to five airports,\n\n    Laos to two airports and the Philippines said its main airport in\n\n    Manila couldn't handle any increase in traffic that a true Open Skies\n\n    policy would bring. In addition, agreement on the so-called \"7th\n\n    freedom traffic rights,\" which would allow carriers the right to carry\n\n    passengers and cargo between two foreign countries without any\n\n    continuing service to one's own country, remains an open issue.\n\n    Despite these shortcomings in the ASEAN agreement, the bloc\n\n    itself says it is now in a position to cut deals with the United States,\n\n    the European Union, India, China, Japan and Russia and perhaps\n\n    the UK now that that country has voted to leave the EU,\n\n    IJUnder these agreements, there will be greater regional and domestic\n\n    air transport connectivity, which will facilitate greater growth\n\n    of the aviation industry, the tourism sector, as well as of the whole\n\n    regional economy,\" ASEAN says in its official Open Skies policy documents.\n\n    \"ASEAN member states are working toward advancing safer\n\n    and more secure skies, enhancing traffic management efficiency\n\n    and capacity through a seamless ASEAN sky, and fostering greater\n\n    air connectivity including the conclusion of aviation agreements\n\n    with dialogue partners, All of these will contribute toward deeper\n\n    ASEAN integration, as it enters the next phase of consolidation as\n\n    a dynamic and open ASEAN Community,\"\n\n    In addition to limits placed on some access points by member states, several ASEAN countries fall short\n\n    of meeting all the rules and regulations put\n\n    in place by the International Civil Aviation\n\n    Organisation (ICAO). Indonesia and Thailand\n\n    are two that come to mind and several others\n\n    are falling short of requirements put in\n\n    place by regions like the US and EU,\n\n    Wolfgang Sander-Fischer, an international\n\n    aviation consultant, told AAV in an interview\n\n    that ASEAN will at some point include the\n\n    7th freedom rights and said while the current\n\n    state is not \"full liberalisation, this a further,\n\n    major goal that may reasonably be achieved\n\n    within the next five years if political will is exercised by all ASEAN member states and harmonisation efforts\n\n    are increased.\"\n\n    Sander-Fischer also said ASEAN restrictions in places like Manila\n\n    and Indonesia and restrictions in air traffic management \"need to be\n\n    alleviated as soon as possible\" and agreed that ASEAN members\n\n    \"need to increase their investments to alleviate aviation infrastructure\n\n    bottlenecks if they wish to accommodate the anticipated increase in\n\n    regional and domestic airtransport.\"\n\n    IJAII airlines based in ASEAN are set to benefit from liberalisation of\n\n    aviation in ASEAN as these may utilise many new routings that are\n\n    being opened up. To reap full benefits, however, adaptive business\n\n    models will likely do better than traditional ones and enhanced collaboration\n\n    among airlines will be beneficial,\" Sander-Fischer told AAV,\n\n    Winners &amp; Losers\n\n    There will be some winners as ASEAN implements the Open Skies\n\n    policy, LCCs and makers of smaller aircraft are expected to benefit\n\n    from the plan and regions like Singapore could also benefit because\n\n    the city-state has an established baseinChangi International Airport\n\n    that also has a well formulated growth plan in place that will allow\n\n    it to increase its capacity. The benefit for LCCs is that many of the region's top destinations are no more than two hours apart, which\n\n    is the sweet-spot for low-cost carriers.\n\n    Malaysia's AirAsia, Indonesia's Lion Air, and Philippine carrier\n\n    Cebu Pacific, all plan to expand their operations with AirAsia saying\n\n    it wants to develop more traffic to the Philippines and Indonesia,\n\n    Full-service airlines like Thai Airways, Garuda Indonesia and Philippine\n\n    Airlines are planning to use their long-haul network to connect\n\n    passengers to their Southeast Asia services,\n\n    Manufacturers of regional aircraft in the 70 to 130-seat range like\n\n    Brazil's Embraer, Canada's Bombardier and ATRf a joint venture between\n\n    Airbus and Italy's Finmeccanica, are also expected to benefit\n\n    since those aircraft can serve shorter regional routes for much less\n\n    per seat than Airbus or Boeing jets.\n\n    Probably the biggest challenge to fully implementing a real and lasting\n\n    Open Skies policy is that Southeast Asia's infrastructure is woefully\n\n    lacking. Many airports across the region are operating above their design capacities as any seasoned traveller\n\n    can attest to, leading to long check-in lines,\n\n    delays, and overcrowded skies,\n\n    Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, Manila's\n\n    Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Jakarta's\n\n    Soekarno-Hatta International Airport\n\n    have reached full capacity and the problems\n\n    are spilling over to smaller airports in those\n\n    same countries, Singapore's Changi is probably\n\n    the exception to the rule in Southeast\n\n    Asia with three terminals that can handle 66\n\n    million passengers annually and two more\n\n    under construction.\n\n    Steve Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace,\n\n    Asia-Pacific, said recently that the downside of ASEAN's Open\n\n    Skies policy is that the infrastructure isn't ready for it yet. The region\n\n    lacks the runways and airport numbers to make it really take off and\n\n    falls short on the airside too with shortfalls in air traffic management,\n\n    Colin Mahoney, a senior vice president at Rockwell Collins, concurred,\n\n    saying that \"it is all about capacity management. So there\n\n    is no point having a frequency of flights with empty seats. You've\n\n    got to balance frequency with load factors. Load factors are going\n\n    to be key for any efficient operation.\"\n\n    Paul Nef, Honeywell Aerospace's business development director\n\n    for Asia-Pacific, told /Wthat the ASEAN Open Skies policy, despite\n\n    its current shortcomings, will help spur growth and influence a more\n\n    competitive space by creating a single and unified air transport\n\n    market in the area,\n\n    \"The boom in air traffic creates challenges for the aviation industry.\n\n    Airports across the region are struggling to cope with the increasing\n\n    number of air travellers, especially as the growth in passenger\n\n    traffic outpaces that of airport infrastructure and facilities...While\n\n    countries across the region such as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam\n\n    are looking to expand their airports by building new terminals and\n\n    runways, ASEAN nations should look into equipping airports with\n\n    ..ASEAN nations should\n\n    look into equipping\n\n    airports with the right\n\n    technologies both on the\n\n    ground and in the air to\n\n    reap the most benefits\n\n    from the Open Skies policy.\n\n    PAUL NEF, HONEYWELL\n\n    the right technologies both on the ground and in the air to reap the\n\n    most benefits from the Open Skies policy,\" Nef said,\n\n    Nef also told AAV that ASEAN airports need to improve the flow\n\n    of aircraft arrivals and departures at major airports and that airports,\n\n    airlines and government authorities need to start exploring \"advanced\n\n    technologies they can leverage to cope with this challenge,\n\n    to meet future passenger demand as they expand their airports.\"\n\n    Nef said Honeywell's SmartPath Ground-Based Augmentation\n\n    System for air traffic management \"can help solve critical needs\n\n    such as helping airports better manage air traffic and alleviating\n\n    the pressure on air traffic controllers, while existing expansion and\n\n    infrastructure upgrades take place at airports throughout the region,\"\n\n    Herdman, the AAPA director general, is also concerned about the\n\n    infrastructure shortfalls in the ASEAN region, Herdman says that\n\n    while the agreement is a positive overall for the region, \"the growth in air traffic has often exceeded national expectations, and with\n\n    limited airport runway and terminal capacity at many key airports\n\n    across the region, has led to congestion and scarcity of takeoff and\n\n    landing slots at peak times of the day,\"\n\n    \"Industry is a willing partner, but governments have an important\n\n    role to play in master planning and coordinating the necessary investments\n\n    in associated aviation infrastructure, including airports\n\n    and air navigation services, to keep pace with the projected growth\n\n    in travel and tourism demand. Recruitment and training of skilled\n\n    personnel, including pilots and technicians, is another ongoing\n\n    challenge,\" Herdman told AAV.\n\n    Herdman also told AAV that ASEAN's Open Skies agreement\n\n    could have a role to play in raising the safety standards of airlines\n\n    and airports in the region,\n\n    \"The ASEAN Open Skies policy is focused on air services liberalisation,\n\n    so does not directly address safety related issues. However, there\n\n    have been some suggestions that, in the longer term, ASEAN could\n\n    also play a role in encouraging harmonisation of national licensing\n\n    regimes and other technical standards within the region, ICAO itself\n\n    is also actively engaged in a global effort to raise compliance and\n\n    implementation standards across the world through its 'No Country\n\n    Left Behind' programme with similar objectives,\" Herdman said.\n\n    The ASEAN Open Skies agreement is expected to be a boon for\n\n    manufacturers, especially makers of smaller regional jets like Embraer\n\n    and in some countries for makers of turboprops.\n\n    Embraer's vice president for Asia-Pacific, Mark Dunnachie, told\n\n    AAV in a phone interview from Farnborough that \"from our perspective\n\n    we'd like to see it (Open Skies) go a lot faster and everyone with\n\n    a stake in it would like to see that, but anything that takes us in a\n\n    direction we want to go is a good course,\" he said,\n\n    \"We're strong advocates of pushing this, but we also believe it's a\n\n    matter of the region right-sizing the aircraft,\" he added, referring to\n\n    the fact that the majority of routes in Southeast Asia are less than\n\n    two hours flight time with smaller passenger loads and \"we don't\n\n    think it's smart to fly the wrong kind of capacity. The legacy carriers\n\n    cannot continue with the current model If you're not making money\n\n    today, you'll never make money.

"fulltext": "\r\n    The 10-member bloc making up\r\n\r\n    the Association of Southeast Asian\r\n\r\n    Nations (ASEAN) reached a milestone\r\n\r\n    in 2016 with the full ratification of\r\n\r\n    its Open Skies policy agreement\r\n\r\n    between members. How successfully\r\n\r\n    the group can implement the plan\r\n\r\n    remains in question. AAV editor\r\n\r\n    Matt Driskill explains.\r\n\r\n    AFTER YEARS OF PLANNING and more recently lots of political\r\n\r\n    wrangling, ASEAN's Open Skies policy agreement was finally concluded\r\n\r\n    by all 10 members of the bloc in April this year sort of. Like\r\n\r\n    China's brand of capitalism with Chinese characteristics, ASEAN's\r\n\r\n    brand of open skies means members of the bloc will be able to fly into each others' capitals, but some countries, like Indonesia, Laos\r\n\r\n    and the Philippines, have put restrictions in place that will limit\r\n\r\n    access to specific areas and airports, The Philippines has also said\r\n\r\n    Manila is off-limits to its fellow ASEAN members,\r\n\r\n    Those limits, and ASEAN's built-in foundational weakness as an\r\n\r\n    association with no enforcement mechanism to make members obey\r\n\r\n    the rules, means ASEAN may never have a truly full and complete\r\n\r\n    Open Skies pact like that in Europe or the United States.\r\n\r\n    Andrew Herdman, the director general of the Association of Asia\r\n\r\n    Pacific Airlines (AAPA), said in March that the \"problem with ASEAN\r\n\r\n    is that it's not a top-down organisation but built on consenses..,so\r\n\r\n    the pace of implementation varies and you've got some countries\r\n\r\n    that are slower than others.\"\r\n\r\n    The bloc is made up of Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, Thailand,\r\n\r\n    Cambodia, the Philippines, Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Singapore,\r\n\r\n    All of these nations are home to low-cost carriers (LCCs) and\r\n\r\n    some well-recognised brand name full-service carriers, None of the\r\n\r\n    nations want to see their respective market share diminished by\r\n\r\n    fellow ASEAN members.\r\n\r\n    Citing concerns about congestion and admitting that competition\r\n\r\n    concerns were also in play, Indonesia limited access to five airports,\r\n\r\n    Laos to two airports and the Philippines said its main airport in\r\n\r\n    Manila couldn't handle any increase in traffic that a true Open Skies\r\n\r\n    policy would bring. In addition, agreement on the so-called \"7th\r\n\r\n    freedom traffic rights,\" which would allow carriers the right to carry\r\n\r\n    passengers and cargo between two foreign countries without any\r\n\r\n    continuing service to one's own country, remains an open issue.\r\n\r\n    Despite these shortcomings in the ASEAN agreement, the bloc\r\n\r\n    itself says it is now in a position to cut deals with the United States,\r\n\r\n    the European Union, India, China, Japan and Russia and perhaps\r\n\r\n    the UK now that that country has voted to leave the EU,\r\n\r\n    IJUnder these agreements, there will be greater regional and domestic\r\n\r\n    air transport connectivity, which will facilitate greater growth\r\n\r\n    of the aviation industry, the tourism sector, as well as of the whole\r\n\r\n    regional economy,\" ASEAN says in its official Open Skies policy documents.\r\n\r\n    \"ASEAN member states are working toward advancing safer\r\n\r\n    and more secure skies, enhancing traffic management efficiency\r\n\r\n    and capacity through a seamless ASEAN sky, and fostering greater\r\n\r\n    air connectivity including the conclusion of aviation agreements\r\n\r\n    with dialogue partners, All of these will contribute toward deeper\r\n\r\n    ASEAN integration, as it enters the next phase of consolidation as\r\n\r\n    a dynamic and open ASEAN Community,\"\r\n\r\n    In addition to limits placed on some access points by member states, several ASEAN countries fall short\r\n\r\n    of meeting all the rules and regulations put\r\n\r\n    in place by the International Civil Aviation\r\n\r\n    Organisation (ICAO). Indonesia and Thailand\r\n\r\n    are two that come to mind and several others\r\n\r\n    are falling short of requirements put in\r\n\r\n    place by regions like the US and EU,\r\n\r\n    Wolfgang Sander-Fischer, an international\r\n\r\n    aviation consultant, told AAV in an interview\r\n\r\n    that ASEAN will at some point include the\r\n\r\n    7th freedom rights and said while the current\r\n\r\n    state is not \"full liberalisation, this a further,\r\n\r\n    major goal that may reasonably be achieved\r\n\r\n    within the next five years if political will is exercised by all ASEAN member states and harmonisation efforts\r\n\r\n    are increased.\"\r\n\r\n    Sander-Fischer also said ASEAN restrictions in places like Manila\r\n\r\n    and Indonesia and restrictions in air traffic management \"need to be\r\n\r\n    alleviated as soon as possible\" and agreed that ASEAN members\r\n\r\n    \"need to increase their investments to alleviate aviation infrastructure\r\n\r\n    bottlenecks if they wish to accommodate the anticipated increase in\r\n\r\n    regional and domestic airtransport.\"\r\n\r\n    IJAII airlines based in ASEAN are set to benefit from liberalisation of\r\n\r\n    aviation in ASEAN as these may utilise many new routings that are\r\n\r\n    being opened up. To reap full benefits, however, adaptive business\r\n\r\n    models will likely do better than traditional ones and enhanced collaboration\r\n\r\n    among airlines will be beneficial,\" Sander-Fischer told AAV,\r\n\r\n    Winners & Losers\r\n\r\n    There will be some winners as ASEAN implements the Open Skies\r\n\r\n    policy, LCCs and makers of smaller aircraft are expected to benefit\r\n\r\n    from the plan and regions like Singapore could also benefit because\r\n\r\n    the city-state has an established baseinChangi International Airport\r\n\r\n    that also has a well formulated growth plan in place that will allow\r\n\r\n    it to increase its capacity. The benefit for LCCs is that many of the region's top destinations are no more than two hours apart, which\r\n\r\n    is the sweet-spot for low-cost carriers.\r\n\r\n    Malaysia's AirAsia, Indonesia's Lion Air, and Philippine carrier\r\n\r\n    Cebu Pacific, all plan to expand their operations with AirAsia saying\r\n\r\n    it wants to develop more traffic to the Philippines and Indonesia,\r\n\r\n    Full-service airlines like Thai Airways, Garuda Indonesia and Philippine\r\n\r\n    Airlines are planning to use their long-haul network to connect\r\n\r\n    passengers to their Southeast Asia services,\r\n\r\n    Manufacturers of regional aircraft in the 70 to 130-seat range like\r\n\r\n    Brazil's Embraer, Canada's Bombardier and ATRf a joint venture between\r\n\r\n    Airbus and Italy's Finmeccanica, are also expected to benefit\r\n\r\n    since those aircraft can serve shorter regional routes for much less\r\n\r\n    per seat than Airbus or Boeing jets.\r\n\r\n    Probably the biggest challenge to fully implementing a real and lasting\r\n\r\n    Open Skies policy is that Southeast Asia's infrastructure is woefully\r\n\r\n    lacking. Many airports across the region are operating above their design capacities as any seasoned traveller\r\n\r\n    can attest to, leading to long check-in lines,\r\n\r\n    delays, and overcrowded skies,\r\n\r\n    Bangkok's Suvarnabhumi Airport, Manila's\r\n\r\n    Ninoy Aquino International Airport and Jakarta's\r\n\r\n    Soekarno-Hatta International Airport\r\n\r\n    have reached full capacity and the problems\r\n\r\n    are spilling over to smaller airports in those\r\n\r\n    same countries, Singapore's Changi is probably\r\n\r\n    the exception to the rule in Southeast\r\n\r\n    Asia with three terminals that can handle 66\r\n\r\n    million passengers annually and two more\r\n\r\n    under construction.\r\n\r\n    Steve Lien, president of Honeywell Aerospace,\r\n\r\n    Asia-Pacific, said recently that the downside of ASEAN's Open\r\n\r\n    Skies policy is that the infrastructure isn't ready for it yet. The region\r\n\r\n    lacks the runways and airport numbers to make it really take off and\r\n\r\n    falls short on the airside too with shortfalls in air traffic management,\r\n\r\n    Colin Mahoney, a senior vice president at Rockwell Collins, concurred,\r\n\r\n    saying that \"it is all about capacity management. So there\r\n\r\n    is no point having a frequency of flights with empty seats. You've\r\n\r\n    got to balance frequency with load factors. Load factors are going\r\n\r\n    to be key for any efficient operation.\"\r\n\r\n    Paul Nef, Honeywell Aerospace's business development director\r\n\r\n    for Asia-Pacific, told /Wthat the ASEAN Open Skies policy, despite\r\n\r\n    its current shortcomings, will help spur growth and influence a more\r\n\r\n    competitive space by creating a single and unified air transport\r\n\r\n    market in the area,\r\n\r\n    \"The boom in air traffic creates challenges for the aviation industry.\r\n\r\n    Airports across the region are struggling to cope with the increasing\r\n\r\n    number of air travellers, especially as the growth in passenger\r\n\r\n    traffic outpaces that of airport infrastructure and facilities...While\r\n\r\n    countries across the region such as Thailand, Indonesia and Vietnam\r\n\r\n    are looking to expand their airports by building new terminals and\r\n\r\n    runways, ASEAN nations should look into equipping airports with\r\n\r\n    ..ASEAN nations should\r\n\r\n    look into equipping\r\n\r\n    airports with the right\r\n\r\n    technologies both on the\r\n\r\n    ground and in the air to\r\n\r\n    reap the most benefits\r\n\r\n    from the Open Skies policy.\r\n\r\n    PAUL NEF, HONEYWELL\r\n\r\n    the right technologies both on the ground and in the air to reap the\r\n\r\n    most benefits from the Open Skies policy,\" Nef said,\r\n\r\n    Nef also told AAV that ASEAN airports need to improve the flow\r\n\r\n    of aircraft arrivals and departures at major airports and that airports,\r\n\r\n    airlines and government authorities need to start exploring \"advanced\r\n\r\n    technologies they can leverage to cope with this challenge,\r\n\r\n    to meet future passenger demand as they expand their airports.\"\r\n\r\n    Nef said Honeywell's SmartPath Ground-Based Augmentation\r\n\r\n    System for air traffic management \"can help solve critical needs\r\n\r\n    such as helping airports better manage air traffic and alleviating\r\n\r\n    the pressure on air traffic controllers, while existing expansion and\r\n\r\n    infrastructure upgrades take place at airports throughout the region,\"\r\n\r\n    Herdman, the AAPA director general, is also concerned about the\r\n\r\n    infrastructure shortfalls in the ASEAN region, Herdman says that\r\n\r\n    while the agreement is a positive overall for the region, \"the growth in air traffic has often exceeded national expectations, and with\r\n\r\n    limited airport runway and terminal capacity at many key airports\r\n\r\n    across the region, has led to congestion and scarcity of takeoff and\r\n\r\n    landing slots at peak times of the day,\"\r\n\r\n    \"Industry is a willing partner, but governments have an important\r\n\r\n    role to play in master planning and coordinating the necessary investments\r\n\r\n    in associated aviation infrastructure, including airports\r\n\r\n    and air navigation services, to keep pace with the projected growth\r\n\r\n    in travel and tourism demand. Recruitment and training of skilled\r\n\r\n    personnel, including pilots and technicians, is another ongoing\r\n\r\n    challenge,\" Herdman told AAV.\r\n\r\n    Herdman also told AAV that ASEAN's Open Skies agreement\r\n\r\n    could have a role to play in raising the safety standards of airlines\r\n\r\n    and airports in the region,\r\n\r\n    \"The ASEAN Open Skies policy is focused on air services liberalisation,\r\n\r\n    so does not directly address safety related issues. However, there\r\n\r\n    have been some suggestions that, in the longer term, ASEAN could\r\n\r\n    also play a role in encouraging harmonisation of national licensing\r\n\r\n    regimes and other technical standards within the region, ICAO itself\r\n\r\n    is also actively engaged in a global effort to raise compliance and\r\n\r\n    implementation standards across the world through its 'No Country\r\n\r\n    Left Behind' programme with similar objectives,\" Herdman said.\r\n\r\n    The ASEAN Open Skies agreement is expected to be a boon for\r\n\r\n    manufacturers, especially makers of smaller regional jets like Embraer\r\n\r\n    and in some countries for makers of turboprops.\r\n\r\n    Embraer's vice president for Asia-Pacific, Mark Dunnachie, told\r\n\r\n    AAV in a phone interview from Farnborough that \"from our perspective\r\n\r\n    we'd like to see it (Open Skies) go a lot faster and everyone with\r\n\r\n    a stake in it would like to see that, but anything that takes us in a\r\n\r\n    direction we want to go is a good course,\" he said,\r\n\r\n    \"We're strong advocates of pushing this, but we also believe it's a\r\n\r\n    matter of the region right-sizing the aircraft,\" he added, referring to\r\n\r\n    the fact that the majority of routes in Southeast Asia are less than\r\n\r\n    two hours flight time with smaller passenger loads and \"we don't\r\n\r\n    think it's smart to fly the wrong kind of capacity. The legacy carriers\r\n\r\n    cannot continue with the current model If you're not making money\r\n\r\n    today, you'll never make money. There's been too much focus on the\r\n\r\n    seat-mile cost and we're trying to balance that with the trip cost,\"\r\n\r\n    Dunnachie also said some Southeast Asian countries may be\r\n\r\n    going down the wrong road in developing mega hub airports and\r\n\r\n    instead should focus on increasing the number of flights and moving\r\n\r\n    passengers more easily and fluidly in and out of the airport.\r\n\r\n    \"If you put Jakarta or Manila alongside Atlanta or Phoenix, the air\r\n\r\n    space is not being optimised. We need to be able to exit the airspace\r\n\r\n    quicker and there's scope to get more movements per hour out of\r\n\r\n    that,\" Dunnachie said, \"Don't give me a shopping mail.

There, we're greeted by one of the most extraordinary sights in nature. It's the aurora borealis, the Northern Lights, bright and vast overhead.\n\n    For many travellers writing up their bucket lists, the Northern Lights come in at No. 1 as the thing they most want to see before they die. We've come here, to the small town of Bjorkliden in Swedish Lapland, to cross the item off our lists.\n\n    The lights appear as a huge, bow-like band stretching over our heads from horizon to horizon. As we watched, the bow splits in two and then merges again, flowing and rippling like water.\n\n    \"I never get tired of it,\" says Jonny. \"It makes me feel so small the vastness of it.\"\n\n    My reaction is different. Rather than vast and distant, to me the lights feel so close, directly overhead, that I feel like I could reach up and run my fingers through them.\n\n    Occasionally strange pulses run through the ribbons of light, looking almost like waves on an oscilloscope. Later in the evening, the lights appear again, this time in a spiral shape that bends and twists before disappearing before our eyes.\n\n    What is it about the lights that have seen the phenomena top multiple surveys of the ultimate bucket list activities, beating out experiences like seeing Niagara Falls, the Pyramids of Giza, and the Grand Canyon?\n\n    Aside from being visually spectacular, perhaps it is their ephemeral nature that makes them so desired. This is not like visiting the Grand Canyon - it is not just \"there\", permanently, waiting to be seen. The stars (or perhaps more accurately, the sun) must align for the lights to be seen.\n\n    Bjorkliden and neighbouring Kiruna, a small region of about 20,000, sits on the edge of the huge Tornetrask Lake and Abisko National Park, 250 kilometres inside the Arctic Circle. It's known as one of the best places in the world to see the Northern Lights, thanks to its location in a climate \"rain shadow\". But the forecast for our four-day visit is not great, with cloud and snowfalls predicted, which makes the almost immediate appearance of the lights such a thrill.\n\n    Being able to see the lights isn't just about the weather. Yes, clear skies are important, but there are other factors that come into play.\n\n    The displays are caused by electrons colliding with the Earth's upper atmosphere, carried by the solar wind. The Earth's magnetic fields pull these to the north and south poles, creating an oval of aurora activity around these regions.\n\n    This activity reportedly occurs around half the days of any given year, but that doesn't necessarily mean it will be visible at these times. In summer, the long days make the aurora more difficult to see. As a result, aurora seekers are advised to head north in the depths of winter, when darkness descends in the mid-afternoon.\n\n    And this year is a good time to make that trip. Sunspot activity shifts on an 11-year cycle and this year is the last high activity period before things slow down for the next decade. That said, Jonny points out that in areas in the far north of Sweden like Bjorkliden, aurora activity will remain relatively normal during this cycle.\n\n    Our home for the stay is a private cabin at Hotell Fjallet on the slopes surrounding the lake.\n\n    The little lodge is a delightful space, with a balcony, two bedrooms, a living area and a kitchen. We even have our own sauna, which we make good use of after long periods out in the snow.\n\n    Aside from its attraction as an aurora hotspot, Bjorkliden is also a popular place for other winter activities - skiing, dogsledding, snowshoeing and snowmobiling are all popular with visitors (the latter particularly with Norwegians, who cross the nearby border to engage in this hobby.\n\n    Snowmobiling is highly restricted in Norway).\n\n    On our first day after arriving we head out for a hike in the wild outskirts of town. Our guide, local outdoorsman Anders, sets us up with snowshoes and takes us on a short walk through the national park. Our plan to walk along the frozen river is foiled by the lack of solid ice covering the water.\n\n    Although it's December, the true winter is late in arriving and the lakes and rivers in the area are yet to freeze. So instead we sit on a couple of reindeer pelts and enjoy some local fare - salted reindeer meat, cooked over an open fire. It's incredibly tasty and, I'm told, much healthier than beef. But by 3pm it's already getting dark so we head back to the hotel before an evening of aurora hunting.\n\n    We take a chairlift to the Sky Station for dinner, a mountain-top observation centre and restaurant offering spectacular views over the surrounding region during the day, and views of the aurora at night.\n\n    Unfortunately, the wind is howling and with it comes heavy snowfall, so there's no chance to see the aurora tonight.\n\n    The same thing happens again the next night when I head out on an aurora photography tour. It's cloudy and snowing, but for a brief moment the stars become visible.\n\n    Our guide advises us to start snapping (the aurora is notoriously difficult to capture and this photography tour from Lights Over Lapland shows us exactly how to set up our camera to do so).\n\n    I point my camera at the treetops and, after a long exposure, I note there's a greenish hue at the bottom of my display screen.\n\n    \"That's the aurora,\" explains my guide. It's not visible to the naked eye, but it's there.\n\n    The wind and snow are gone on our final night but the aurora again eludes us. Above the hotel is a frozen lake and surrounding it, a handful of traditional fishermen's huts, once used for ice fishing but now converted into cosy spaces with a bed and heating.\n\n    Outside we have a cauldron with a roaring fire. It's a beautiful setting and we feel completely isolated, despite only being a short distance from the hotel. It would be the perfect place to enjoy a night under the aurora, if it had only shown up.\n\n    So while we're disappointed to have not seen the lights every night of our stay, we're also thrilled to have seen them at the beginning.\n\n    And the experience of visiting this remote Swedish village and national park has, in itself, been worth the trip.\n\n    And while this particular bucket list item is ready to be crossed off, I'm not quite ready to do that yet.\n\n    Like Jonny, getting a taste of this spectacular natural phenomenon has only made me want to see it tagain.\n\n    TRIP NOTES MORE INFORMATION offthemaptravel.co.uk GETTING THERE Etihad flies from Melbourne, Sydney, Brisbane and Perth to Abu Dhabi with connections to Berlin through Air Berlin.

Barnes is the understudy for award-winning actor Sheridan Smith and, with just a couple of hours notice, she's turned in her first performance as Fanny Brice, the lead role. It was faultless and gutsy, sensitive and brilliant.\n\n    It's this immediacy and unpredictability of live theatre that makes it so wonderful, and the Brits are mad for it.\n\n    London alone has 240 theatres, and they say that each year nationwide more people go to the theatre than attend all the Premier League football matches put together.\n\n    And since 2016 is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, London is really flaunting its theatrical heritage.\n\n    My tour of London's theatre scene starts inauspiciously on a temporary platform overlooking a dark, cavernlike space under an ugly office block.\n\n    Rows of red LED lights trace hexagonal outlines on the muddy floor, joining up lines of semisubmerged foundation timbers.\n\n    I'm told this is all that's left of the Rose Theatre, built in 1587.\n\n    It's a strangely absorbing spot, but hard for me to picture that the 23year-old William Shakespeare saw several of his earliest works staged there. A couple of hundred metres away on what is now London's bustling Bankside area, it's a different story. The Globe is a magnificent three-storey reconstruction of the theatre where Shakespeare's most successful plays were first performed.\n\n    Here the beret-wearing guide tells me that audiences were hard to please. Criticism wasn't in the form of rotten tomatoes in Shakespeare's heyday, as they were yet to arrive in Europe from Latin America. It's thought that apples were the flinging fruit of choice.\n\n    Theatregoers also belched and shouted openly, ate nuts, pears, shellfish, and drank warm beer. Other local distractions included brothels, gambling and bear baiting.\n\n    Just as in Shakespeare's time, most of the stage and the area in front are open to the elements. It's all encircled by steep seating (arranged in a hexagon) and roofed with thatch.\n\n    I stand with the other so-called \"groundlings\" in front of the stage they used to pay about a penny in the early 17th century, but now up to 700 of us can get in for just a fiver.\n\n    This performance of Twelfth Night is part of the \"Playing Shakespeare\" program designed to introduce youngsters to his work.\n\n    The lines are original, but it features water pistols and pop music clips, and the show is a hoot. Alex Mugnaioni's Malvolio's wooing of Countess Olivia in yellow socks and cross garters is the funniest I've seen.\n\n    It's not all about the Bard though, and even Malvolio's legwear can't compete with that evening's performance of Kinky Boots, a production of which opens at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne next month. It's the true story of a young straight-laced shoe factory owner from Northampton forming an unlikely business partnership with a London-based drag queen to produce custom footwear for her fraternity.\n\n    Songs are by Cindy Lauper, the outrageous thigh-high boots are by costume designer Gregg Barnes, and the astonishingly good Matt Henry supplies spades of mood-lifting designer-in-drag presence.\n\n    Thankfully everything is all right on the night for Henry - despite his eight-inch heels - but that's not always the case, and the concept of things not going to plan is presented on steroids in the hilarious Play That Goes Wrong.\n\n    It's hard to stop laughing from the moment a non-existent dog goes missing while the seats are filling, to the set and cast collapsing in spectacular style at the finale.\n\n    Next day at the National Theatre's production of As You Like It a scene change entirely devoid of characters draws wondrous applause.\n\n    Set designer Lizzie Clachan has threaded furniture together in such a way that a cheery call centre morphs into a forbidding Forest of Arden. Chains clank, furniture creaks and metal table and chairs are wrenched upwards to form an astonishingly dystopian bead curtain from floor to rafters.\n\n    Peeking behind the scenes is positively encouraged at the National Theatre, where its new Sherling High-Level Walkway takes you inside the building past the prop stores and workshops.\n\n    I do a guided 75-minute tour where I see new sets being painted, as well as some of the five levels - yes, five below the revolving stage.\n\n    The tour at the Royal Opera House is even more impressive.\n\n    The rouge opulence of the five-tier and 2250-seat auditorium is breathtaking, but this is just the opening act.\n\n    The guide leads me through a tiny \"smoking room\" put under the Royal Box especially for King Edward.\n\n    The sets in waiting are gigantic: in a prop workshop I see a beaten up Triumph Toledo car parked in a corner by a warthog's head, while an artisan painstakingly weaves fabric on to a prop chair.\n\n    The tour ends with a hushed squeeze past a ballerina being guided through a step by her teacher. Like all the best West End productions, I'd critique this tour as unmissable.\n\n    Over the next few days I cram in Motown The Musical, a tense thriller called The Maids, Matilda The Musical, and Mrs Henderson Presents - based on the film about London's Windmill Theatre.\n\n    Yet for sheer intimate exuberance, it's hard to top Funny Girl.\n\n    Natasha Barnes, incidentally, has since gone on to play the part hundreds of times (due to Sheridan Smith's absence becoming an extended break).\n\n    She's back understudying again, but I'm sure that in the years to come I'll be boasting of the night that I didn't see Sheridan Smith in Funny Girl. And that's the magic of theatre.\n\n    THE WRITER WAS A GUEST OF VISIT BRITAIN.\n\n    LONDON THEATRE TIPS BOOKING The official Society of London Theatre TKTS booth on Leicester Square is the place for cut-price, last-minute seats (tkts.co.uk/whats-on-sale). Some theatres release 10-20 tickets for that day, available to buy only in person from their box office, from 10. And the National Theatre has hundreds of Travelex sponsored 15 seats for every performance (nationaltheatre.org.uk/travelex).\n\n    WHERE TO SIT Most theatres have three levels - ground floor is the stalls (great for intimacy and atmosphere), the first tier and best seats are the first five to 10 rows of the circle (elevated views and grand for kids due to the steep angle), and upper circle seats are cheapest (can be far from the stage and have restricted views). You'll find detailed theatre-by-theatre seating advice at theatremonkey.com.\n\n    ETIQUETTE Almost anything goes dress-wise, except for shorts and singlets, and (perhaps surprisingly) black tie. Arrive 30 minutes before curtain-up, as many London venues are historic (read cramped), with narrow staircases and well-hidden toilets.\n\n    Dimming the lights is the cue for quiet and failing to switch off your mobile will elicit withering tut-tuts from those around you.\n\n    ESCAPE ROUTE LONDON GETTING THERE Qantas and British Airways fly from Sydney to London.\n\n    Or Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad fly from other Australian cities via their respective Gulf hubs.\n\n    STAYING THERE Two good hotels in London's Theatreland are the refined One Aldwich (onealdwych.com), occupying a former Edwardian newspaper head office building withcurves and high ceilings, and the arty and theatrical St Martins Lane (morganshotelgroup.com) with floor-to-ceiling windows in the rooms and a buzzing atmosphere.\n\n    BACKSTAGE TOURS nationaltheatre.org.uk and roh.org.uk\n\nCaption Text:\nShakespeare's Globe Theatre, London (main); the entrance to a West End world of wonder (above left); and the London Coliseum (above right), which first opened in 1904.

Like all the best West End productions, I'd critique this tour as unmissable.\r\n\r\n    Over the next few days I cram in Motown The Musical, a tense thriller called The Maids, Matilda The Musical, and Mrs Henderson Presents - based on the film about London's Windmill Theatre.\r\n\r\n    Yet for sheer intimate exuberance, it's hard to top Funny Girl.\r\n\r\n    Natasha Barnes, incidentally, has since gone on to play the part hundreds of times (due to Sheridan Smith's absence becoming an extended break).\r\n\r\n    She's back understudying again, but I'm sure that in the years to come I'll be boasting of the night that I didn't see Sheridan Smith in Funny Girl. And that's the magic of theatre.\r\n\r\n    THE WRITER WAS A GUEST OF VISIT BRITAIN.\r\n\r\n    LONDON THEATRE TIPS BOOKING The official Society of London Theatre TKTS booth on Leicester Square is the place for cut-price, last-minute seats (tkts.co.uk/whats-on-sale). Some theatres release 10-20 tickets for that day, available to buy only in person from their box office, from 10. And the National Theatre has hundreds of Travelex sponsored 15 seats for every performance (nationaltheatre.org.uk/travelex).\r\n\r\n    WHERE TO SIT Most theatres have three levels - ground floor is the stalls (great for intimacy and atmosphere), the first tier and best seats are the first five to 10 rows of the circle (elevated views and grand for kids due to the steep angle), and upper circle seats are cheapest (can be far from the stage and have restricted views). You'll find detailed theatre-by-theatre seating advice at theatremonkey.com.\r\n\r\n    ETIQUETTE Almost anything goes dress-wise, except for shorts and singlets, and (perhaps surprisingly) black tie. Arrive 30 minutes before curtain-up, as many London venues are historic (read cramped), with narrow staircases and well-hidden toilets.\r\n\r\n    Dimming the lights is the cue for quiet and failing to switch off your mobile will elicit withering tut-tuts from those around you.\r\n\r\n    ESCAPE ROUTE LONDON GETTING THERE Qantas and British Airways fly from Sydney to London.\r\n\r\n    Or Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad fly from other Australian cities via their respective Gulf hubs.\r\n\r\n    STAYING THERE Two good hotels in London's Theatreland are the refined One Aldwich (onealdwych.com), occupying a former Edwardian newspaper head office building withcurves and high ceilings, and the arty and theatrical St Martins Lane (morganshotelgroup.com) with floor-to-ceiling windows in the rooms and a buzzing atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    BACKSTAGE TOURS nationaltheatre.org.uk and roh.org.uk\r\n\r\nCaption Text:\r\nShakespeare's Globe Theatre, London (main); the entrance to a West End world of wonder (above left); and the London Coliseum (above right), which first opened in 1904.

The Australian understands Jetstar has made repairs to 11 of those GEnx engines, meaning that some flights continue to be powered by engines with the issue. Boeing Dreamliners, however, are able to fly with only one engine working.\n\n    \"GE has been working with our engineering team on this and we will complete the modifications on the remaining engines around five months ahead of schedule in November this year,\" the Jetstar spokesman said.\n\n    The engine issue also affects Dreamliners operated by airlines such as Air Canada, Air India, China Southern, United Airlines and Etihad Airways that fly from Australian airports.\n\n    General Electric has defended the GEnx engine, used on about 270 Dreamliners and which has close to four million flight hours, saying it continually analyses the performance of the GEnx engine fleet, which has displayed \"outstanding \"reliability\".\n\n    There have been more than 20 incidents of in-flight engine failures with the GEnx engine dating back to 2013, not long after the Boeing Dreamliner aircraft first took to the skies for commercial operations.\n\n    Of the 22 recorded incidents, 15 were severe enough that pilots in charge of the aircraft switched off the engine mid-flight and returned to their port of origin or diverted to a nearby airport.</full></item></root>",

BCA chief Jennifer Westacott, AFL commissioner Sam Mostyn, AMP chairwoman Catherine Brenner, Jetstar boss Jane Hrdlicka, Macquarie Group's Shemara Wikramanayake, REA Group's Tracey Fellows, Carnival's Ann Sherry, Bank of Melbourne chairwoman Elizabeth Proust, Woolworths and Nine Entertainment director Holly Kramer, Crown Resorts director Helen Coonan, designer Carla Zampatti, NSW Treasurer Gladys Berejiklian, and Microsoft's Pip Marlow were but a handful of high-powered women in the house.\n\n    IAG chair Elizabeth Bryan, ANZ's new digital banker Maile Carnegie, Coca-Cola AmauTs Alison Watkins, Reserve Bank director Kathryn Fagg, Suncorp board member, Sally Herman and Deloitte boss Cindy Hook swelled their ranks.\n\n    Y chromosomes were comparatively thin on the ground - but those who bore them were of an undeniably impressive calibre. From RBA governor Glenn Stevens to ANZ chairman David Gonski, chief bureaucrat Martin Parkinson to Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, NAB chairman Ken Henry and his CEO Andrew Thorburn, to ANZ chief Shayne Elliott and ASX boss Dominic Stevens - all resplendent in their monkey suits, all deferring respectfully for the evening to the posse of power women in their midst.\n\n    Recalling her experience integrating the two disparate corporate cultures of SingTel and Optus, Ms Chua said she remembered it as being \"definitely character building\".\n\n    Meanwhile, down the Hume Highway, the Midwinter Ball saw the pollies come out to play - in all manner of interesting permutations and combinations (take a bow, Derryn Hinch and Jacqui Lambie).\n\n    Newly-married Telstra chief executive Andy Penn hosted shadow communications minister Michelle Rowland and the PM's principal private secretary Sally Cray, at the next table from Big WCEO Sally Macdonald and Labor frontbencher Jim Chalmers.\n\n    Westpac chief Brian Hartzer sat with Chris Bowen (who said appeasement died with Neville Chamberlain!), while Qantas chairman Big Leigh Clifford hosted his ideological bedfellow (ahem) Anthony Albanese.\n\n    After a pointedly long and visible chat with NSW Liberal powerbroker Michael Photios, the PM joined Seven West Media chief Tim Worner and his neighbour and uni buddy Bruce McWilliam for a gasbag on the sidelines, while Nine Entertainment CEO Hugh Marks chewed an ear off Communications Minister Mitch Fifield.\n\n    Just under $345,000 was raised in the Great Pollie Charity Auction, the main prize for which was JBish's much-hyped dinner in Los Angeles with a Hollywood star.

"fulltext": "\r\n    It was a tale of two power parties Wednesday night as the pollies took on the chicks - and came off second best While Canberra's elite donned their glad rags for the Midwinter Ball, practically every powerful woman in the country - plus a couple of blokes too - crammed into the Westin ballroom in Sydney for the annual Chief Executive Women dinner.\r\n\r\n    As keynote speaker, SingTel Optus boss Chua Sock Koong encouraged her audience to \"lean in, lean out lean in whichever direction works for you\", CEW president Diane Smith Gander used the occasion to issue a rallying cry for gender equity in the boardroom.\r\n\r\n    The guest list alone was enough to put a fissure in glass ceilings all over the country. BCA chief Jennifer Westacott, AFL commissioner Sam Mostyn, AMP chairwoman Catherine Brenner, Jetstar boss Jane Hrdlicka, Macquarie Group's Shemara Wikramanayake, REA Group's Tracey Fellows, Carnival's Ann Sherry, Bank of Melbourne chairwoman Elizabeth Proust, Woolworths and Nine Entertainment director Holly Kramer, Crown Resorts director Helen Coonan, designer Carla Zampatti, NSW Treasurer Gladys Berejiklian, and Microsoft's Pip Marlow were but a handful of high-powered women in the house.\r\n\r\n    IAG chair Elizabeth Bryan, ANZ's new digital banker Maile Carnegie, Coca-Cola AmauTs Alison Watkins, Reserve Bank director Kathryn Fagg, Suncorp board member, Sally Herman and Deloitte boss Cindy Hook swelled their ranks.\r\n\r\n    Y chromosomes were comparatively thin on the ground - but those who bore them were of an undeniably impressive calibre. From RBA governor Glenn Stevens to ANZ chairman David Gonski, chief bureaucrat Martin Parkinson to Qantas CEO Alan Joyce, NAB chairman Ken Henry and his CEO Andrew Thorburn, to ANZ chief Shayne Elliott and ASX boss Dominic Stevens - all resplendent in their monkey suits, all deferring respectfully for the evening to the posse of power women in their midst.\r\n\r\n    Recalling her experience integrating the two disparate corporate cultures of SingTel and Optus, Ms Chua said she remembered it as being \"definitely character building\".\r\n\r\n    Meanwhile, down the Hume Highway, the Midwinter Ball saw the pollies come out to play - in all manner of interesting permutations and combinations (take a bow, Derryn Hinch and Jacqui Lambie).\r\n\r\n    Newly-married Telstra chief executive Andy Penn hosted shadow communications minister Michelle Rowland and the PM's principal private secretary Sally Cray, at the next table from Big WCEO Sally Macdonald and Labor frontbencher Jim Chalmers.\r\n\r\n    Westpac chief Brian Hartzer sat with Chris Bowen (who said appeasement died with Neville Chamberlain!), while Qantas chairman Big Leigh Clifford hosted his ideological bedfellow (ahem) Anthony Albanese.\r\n\r\n    After a pointedly long and visible chat with NSW Liberal powerbroker Michael Photios, the PM joined Seven West Media chief Tim Worner and his neighbour and uni buddy Bruce McWilliam for a gasbag on the sidelines, while Nine Entertainment CEO Hugh Marks chewed an ear off Communications Minister Mitch Fifield.\r\n\r\n    Just under $345,000 was raised in the Great Pollie Charity Auction, the main prize for which was JBish's much-hyped dinner in Los Angeles with a Hollywood star. The star turned out to be Johnny Depp (we can only assume BarnabyJoyce brokered the deal) and the winning bid was an impressive $41,100 (recipient unknown at the time of going to print.. but our money, again, is on Barnaby-because we suspect he is desperate to meet Pistol and Boo - or eat them for dinner, one or the other).\r\n\r\n    But if the Midwinter Ball served to concentrate the nation's political power in one room for one night, the CEW dinner was its lower-key, heavier hitting business counterweight So who won the night?

Barnes is the understudy for award-winning actor Sheridan Smith and, with just a couple of hours notice, she's turned in her first performance as Fanny Brice, the lead role. It was faultless and gutsy, sensitive and brilliant.\n\n    It's this immediacy and unpredictability of live theatre that makes it so wonderful, and the Brits are mad for it.\n\n    London alone has 240 theatres, and they say that each year nationwide more people go to the theatre than attend all the Premier League football matches put together.\n\n    And since 2016 is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, London is really flaunting its theatrical heritage.\n\n    My tour of London's theatre scene starts inauspiciously on a temporary platform overlooking a dark, cavernlike space under an ugly office block.\n\n    Rows of red LED lights trace hexagonal outlines on the muddy floor, joining up lines of semisubmerged foundation timbers.\n\n    I'm told this is all that's left of the Rose Theatre, built in 1587.\n\n    It's a strangely absorbing spot, but hard for me to picture that the 23year-old William Shakespeare saw several of his earliest works staged there. A couple of hundred metres away on what is now London's bustling Bankside area, it's a different story. The Globe is a magnificent three-storey reconstruction of the theatre where Shakespeare's most successful plays were first performed.\n\n    Here the beret-wearing guide tells me that audiences were hard to please. Criticism wasn't in the form of rotten tomatoes in Shakespeare's heyday, as they were yet to arrive in Europe from Latin America.\n\n    It's thought that apples were the flinging fruit of choice. Theatregoers also belched and shouted openly, ate nuts, pears, shellfish and drank warm beer. Other local distractions included brothels, gambling and bear baiting.\n\n    Just as in Shakespeare's time, most of the stage and the area in front are open to the elements. It's all encircled by steep seating (arranged in a hexagon) and roofed with thatch.\n\n    I stand with the other so-called \"groundlings\" in front of the stage they used to pay about a penny in the early 17th century, but now up to 700 of us can get in for just a fiver. This performance of Twelfth Night is part of the \"Playing Shakespeare\" program designed to introduce youngsters to his work.\n\n    The lines are original, but it features water pistols and pop music clips, and the show is a hoot. Alex Mugnaioni's Malvolio's wooing of Countess Olivia in yellow socks and cross garters is the funniest I've seen.\n\n    It's not all about the Bard though, and even Malvolio's legwear can't compete with that evening's performance of Kinky Boots, a production of which opens at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne next month. It's the true story of a young straight-laced shoe factory owner from Northampton forming an unlikely business partnership with a London-based drag queen to produce custom footwear for her fraternity.\n\n    Songs are by Cindy Lauper, the outrageous thigh-high boots are by costume designer Gregg Barnes and the astonishingly good Matt Henry supplies spades of mood-lifting designer-in-drag presence.\n\n    Thankfully everything is all right on the night for Henry - despite his eight-inch heels - but that's not always the case, and the concept of things not going to plan is presented on steroids in the hilarious Play That Goes Wrong.\n\n    It's hard to stop laughing from the moment a non-existent dog goes missing while the seats are filling, to the set and cast collapsing in spectacular style at the finale.\n\n    Next day at the National Theatre's production of As You Like It a scene change entirely devoid of characters draws wondrous applause.\n\n    Set designer Lizzie Clachan has threaded furniture together in such a way that a cheery call centre morphs into a forbidding Forest of Arden.\n\n    Chains clank, furniture creaks and metal table and chairs are wrenched upwards to form an astonishingly dystopian bead curtain from floor to rafters.\n\n    Peeking behind the scenes is positively encouraged at the National Theatre, where its new Sherling High-Level Walkway takes you inside the building past the prop stores and workshops.\n\n    I do a guided 75-minute tour where I see new sets being painted, as well as some of the five levels - yes, five below the revolving stage.\n\n    The tour at the Royal Opera House is even more impressive. The rouge opulence of the five-tier and 2250seat auditorium is breathtaking, but this is just the opening act.\n\n    The guide leads me through a tiny \"smoking room\" put under the Royal Box especially for King Edward. The sets in waiting are gigantic: in a prop workshop I see a beaten up Triumph Toledo car parked in a corner by a warthog's head, while an artisan painstakingly weaves fabric on to a prop chair.\n\n    The tour ends with a hushed squeeze past a ballerina being guided through a step by her teacher. Like all the best West End productions, I'd critique this tour as unmissable.\n\n    Over the next few days I cram in Motown The Musical, a tense thriller called The Maids, Matilda The Musical, and Mrs Henderson Presents - based on the film about London's Windmill Theatre.\n\n    Yet for sheer intimate exuberance, it's hard to top Funny Girl. Natasha Barnes, incidentally, has since gone on to play the part hundreds of times (due to Sheridan Smith's absence becoming an extended break).\n\n    She's back understudying again, but I'm sure that in the years to come I'll be boasting of the night that I didn't see Sheridan Smith in Funny Girl. And that's the magic of theatre.\n\n    THE WRITER WAS A GUEST OF VISIT BRITAIN.\n\n    ESCAPE ROUTE LONDON GETTING THERE Qantas and British Airways fly from Sydney to London. Or Emirates, Qatar Airways and Etihad fly from other Australian cities via their respective Gulf hubs.\n\n    STAYING THERE Two good hotels in London's Theatreland are the refined One Aldwich (onealdwych.com), occupying a former Edwardian newspaper head office building with curves and high ceilings, and the arty and theatrical St Martins Lane (morganshotelgroup.com) with floor-to-ceiling windows in the rooms and a buzzing atmosphere.\n\n    BACKSTAGE TOURS nationaltheatre.org.uk and roh.org.uk MORE PEOPLE GO TO THE THEATRE THAN ATTEND ALL THE PREMIER LEAGUE FOOTBALL MATCHES\n\n    LONDON THEATRE TIPS BOOKING The official Society of London Theatre TKTS booth on Leicester Square is the place for cut-price, last-minute seats (tkts.co.uk/whatson-sale).\n\n    Some theatres release 10-20 tickets for that day, available only to buy in person from their box office, from 10. And the National Theatre has hundreds of Travelex sponsored 15 seats for every performance (nationaltheatre.org.uk/ travelex).\n\n    WHERE TO SIT Most theatres have three levels - ground floor is the stalls (great for intimacy and atmosphere), the first tier and best seats are the first five to 10 rows of the circle (elevated views and grand for kids due to the steep angle), and upper circle seats are cheapest (can be far from the stage and have restricted views).\n\n    You'll find detailed theatreby-theatre seating advice at theatremonkey.com.\n\n    ETIQUETTE Almost anything goes dress wise, except for shorts and singlets and (perhaps surprisingly) black tie.\n\n    Arrive 30 minutes before curtain-up, as many London venues are historic (read cramped), with narrow staircases and wellhidden toilets.\n\n    Dimming the lights is the cue for quiet and failing to switch off your mobile will elicit withering tut-tut's from those around you.\n\nCaption Text:\nShakespeare's Globe Theatre, London , is a popular spot for tourists.\nPICTURES: JOHN TRAMPER, SOCIETY OF LONDON THEATRE</full></item></root>",

Barnes is the understudy for award-winning actor Sheridan Smith and, with just a couple of hours' notice, she's turned in her first performance as Fanny Brice, the lead role. It was faultless and gutsy, sensitive and brilliant.\n\n    It's this immediacy and unpredictability of live theatre that makes it so wonderful, and the Brits are mad for it.\n\n    London alone has 240 theatres, and they say that each year nationwide more people go to the theatre than attend all the Premier League football matches put together.\n\n    And since 2016 is the 400th anniversary of Shakespeare's death, London is really flaunting its theatrical heritage.\n\n    My tour of London's theatre scene starts inauspiciously on a temporary platform overlooking a dark, cavern-like space under an ugly office block. Rows of red LED lights trace hexagonal outlines on the muddy floor, joining up lines of semi-submerged foundation timbers.\n\n    I'm told this is all that's left of the Rose Theatre, built in 1587.\n\n    It's a strangely absorbing spot, but hard for me to picture that the 23-year-old William Shakespeare saw several of his earliest works staged there. A couple of hundred metres away on what is now London's bustling Bankside area, it's a different story. The Globe is a magnificent three-storey reconstruction of the theatre where Shakespeare's most successful plays were first performed.\n\n    Here the beret-wearing guide tells me that audiences were hard to please. Criticism wasn't in the form of rotten tomatoes in Shakespeare's heyday, as they were yet to arrive in Europe from Latin America.\n\n    It's thought that apples were the flinging fruit of choice. Theatregoers also belched and shouted openly, ate nuts, pears, shellfish, and drank warm beer. Other local distractions included brothels, gambling and bear baiting.\n\n    Just as in Shakespeare's time, most of the stage and the area in front are open to the elements. It's all encircled by steep seating (arranged in a hexagon) and roofed with thatch.\n\n    I stand with the other so-called \"groundlings\" in front of the stage they used to pay about a penny in the early 17th century, but now up to 700 of us can get in for just a fiver.\n\n    This performance of Twelfth Night is part of the \"Playing Shakespeare\" program designed to introduce youngsters to his work.\n\n    The lines are original, but it features water pistols and pop music clips, and the show is a hoot. Alex Mugnaioni's Malvolio's wooing of Countess Olivia in yellow socks and cross garters is the funniest I've seen.\n\n    It's not all about the Bard though, and even Malvolio's legwear can't compete with that evening's performance of Kinky Boots, a production of which opens at Her Majesty's Theatre in Melbourne next month. It's the true story of a young straight-laced shoe factory owner from Northampton forming an unlikely business partnership with a London-based drag queen to produce custom footwear for her fraternity.\n\n    Songs are by Cindy Lauper, the outrageous thigh-high boots are by costume designer Gregg Barnes, and the astonishingly good Matt Henry supplies spades of mood-lifting designer-in-drag presence.\n\n    Thankfully everything is all right on the night for Henry - despite his eight-inch heels - but that's not always the case, and the concept of things not going to plan is presented Theatre's production of As You Like It, a scene change entirely devoid of characters draws wondrous applause.\n\n    Set designer Lizzie Clachan has threaded furniture together in such a way that a cheery call centre morphs into a forbidding Forest of Arden.\n\n    Chains clank, furniture creaks and metal table and chairs are wrenched upwards to form an astonishingly dystopian bead curtain from floor to rafters.\n\n    Peeking behind the scenes is positively encouraged at the National Theatre, where its new Sherling High-Level Walkway on steroids in the hilarious Play That Goes Wrong.\n\n    It's hard to stop laughing from the moment a non-existent dog goes missing while the seats are filling, to the set and cast collapsing in spectacular style at the finale.\n\n    Next day at the National takes you inside the building past the prop stores and workshops.\n\n    I do a guided 75-minute tour where I see new sets being painted, as well as some of the five levels - yes, five below the revolving stage.\n\n    The tour at the Royal Opera House is even more impressive.

He grins and looks over at his boss. \"It's his 1 first time,\" says the boss.\n\n    They're joking, of course, but I'm still dubious about my chances of survival as I buckle up in the copilot's seat of a tiny four-seater plane. I'm bound for one of Kenya's most exclusive safari lodges on Laikipia Plateau near Mt Kenya, a 10,000km2 wildlife refuge, home to the second-largest number of elephants in the country. The prospect of seeing even one elephant in the wild is so exciting it gives me the courage to soar off into the sky in this sliver of a plane.\n\n    It's beautiful seeing the farmland around Nairobi give way to vast tracts crisscrossed with animal tracks. We're not five minutes into the flight before the pilot dips the plane's wing and points. 1 follow his gaze, and my eyes fill with tears.\n\n    I completely forget to breathe. Below us, enormous, wild and free, is a majestic elephant wandering the plains.\n\n    The fact I'm so overcome with joy surprises me - 1 didn't see it coming and wonder if I'm going to spend the entire trip covered in goosebumps. I'm about to find out because it's time to land.\n\n    READY TO RETREAT Segera Retreat is nestled in a migratory corridor on 20,200 hectares of protected woodlands, grasslands and fertile riverbeds between Mt Kenya and the Rift Valley.\n\n    This luxurious oasis only opened in 2013, but the idea for a conservation-minded sanctuary came about back in 1989 when its founder visited Africa for the first time and fell in love.\n\n    Back then, Jochen Zeitz was about to take the helm of Puma, becoming the youngest CEO in German history to h ' \" r l company. He was 30 years and would spend the next 18 years turning the sportwear giant's fortunes around.\n\n    Behind the scenes, Zeitz was on a different mission, and in 2008 founded the Zeitz Foundation for Intercultural Ecosphere Safety to benefit nature and humanity.\n\n    Through this non-profit venture, Zeitz launched a Long Run Alliance - its members combining to form a global network of sustainable ecotourism destinations that support communities and preserve natural environments.\n\n    When 1 first arrive I know nothing of Zeitz' values. All 1 know is this place is achingly beautiful. A boardwalk leads to Paddock House, a rustic, two-storey homestead overlooking the vast plains and river beyond. Here I meet Dennis - someone, I inform my partner on return, who I love almost as much as him. Dennis is assigned to look after me during my stay, whether that be accompanying n in the dark on the path from my villa\n\n    dinner, popping a hot water bottle into my sumptuous bed, or running a steaming bubble bath adorned with rose petals for me to sink into on the villa's private deck.\n\n    NATURAL BEAUTY Built of timber and thatch, most of Segera Retreat's eight villas are built on elevated wooden platforms with views over the savannah. Natural timber and crisp white cotton blend effortlessly to create a haven of stylish luxury in secluded peace with a swinging lounge bed, a sunken hot tub and a mosquito net tied with handcrafted beads. A tall spiked hedge is all that separates this oasis from the wilds.\n\n    A paved pathway takes me back to Paddock House, where a table for lunch is set on the verandah. Meals can be held anywhere: by the pool in the thatched lounge area, by candlelight in the stables, or even in the Wine Tower, surrounded by bottles from around the world.\n\n    \"It's about chilling, relaxing, switching off, but reconnecting with yourself,\" Segera's manager, Jens Kozany, tells me when I ask what he and Zeitz hope guests will experience during their stay.\n\n    Today, our table is laden with beautiful salads, many made from fresh ingredients plucked from the vegetable patch. Smoked haloumi, watermelon and feta salad, vegetable kebabs, zucchini and pine nuts light and delicious fare. As we linger and indulge, giraffes wander across the plain with languid grace - it's as if I've always been here; as if I've come home.\n\n    GAME ON The golden glow of late afternoon signals it's time to head out on my first game drive. I don't want to spoil the experience with expectations - I'm open to whatever may come.\n\n    We hop into an open safari truck with guide David Nandio Lenkilili, a Samburu tribesman. We soon stumble upon an elephant family bathed in afternoon light with the snow-capped peak of Mt Kenya behind. As far as memorable moments go, this one is magical. Lenkilili quietly tells us how elephants go about their day. They eat an enormous amount over 18 hours, pushing over trees as they go. The only tree they leave standing is the boscia, which they rub against and use as umbrellas. We're only a few degrees south of the equator, so although nights and\n\n    mornings can be chilly, the heat of the sun during the day drives many animals to find shade. Lenkilili points out scratches on the tree trunk made by leopards climbing. Reaching high up over his head, he shows us where the elephants have been rubbing. It's not until now that I understand how huge these gentle giants really are. I'm at even more of a loss as to how poachers can bring themselves to take them down for ivory, a product that adds zero value to human life.\n\n    One of the mums raises her foot - she's listening for communications from other elephants through the ground. Males travel up to 100 kilometres away from the herd in search of food and send messages via infrasound. The elephants will then remember that spot where they grazed for the next 20 years.\n\n    ANIMAL ENCOUNTERS Before long we encounter gentle giants of a different kind, towering high above the trees. Giraffes feed on the spiky acacia trees - ants living on the trees release a chemical to be carried on the wind warning other ants a giraffe is feeding nearby. Staying downwind is a clever giraffe ploy to remain undetected.\n\n    We see elegant impala and learn that the male of the herd has two months to mate with 40 herd members before being ousted. We see zebras, more elephants, eland and hyenas. The hyenas may be ugly but, as nature's cleaners, they're one of Lenkilili's favourites. Their dung is a giveaway - they devour leftovers, bones and all, of prey killed by predators, the calcium turning their dung bright white.\n\n    It's dark by the time we return to camp. Hours have passed, yet it feels like minutes, and we gather around a bonfire to warm our hands and trade tales with Segera staff. We then move to the cosy setting of the stables and sip champagne by an open fire before dinner. The wooden slab table is set immaculately for the divine meal to come.\n\n    After another day and night of Segera bliss, we fly into the Maasai Mara National Reserve in south-west Kenya and travel by road to Mara Plains Camp. A swinging rope bridge leads into this intimate eco-camp, where nothing appears to separate the seven canvas tents from whatever may roam the plains after dark.\n\n    \"This land belongs to the wildlife; there are no fences here,\" shrugs camp manager Shaun Mousley.\n\n    The tented communal lounge/dining area has sweeping views and stays open all night. In the morning, the floorboards feature the telltale footprints of monkeys.\n\n    We're encouraged to keep our tents zipped as monkeys have been known to bounce on the beds and swing from the chandeliers if they gain access.\n\n    Mara Plains Camp is one of five lodges allowed in the 14,200-hectare Olare Motorogi Conservancy, comprising protected land leased from the Maasai community. Conservancies are highly regulated game reserves that make for a far more rewarding safari adventure than your typical game drive. Regular reserves can be crowded with \"white vultures\" (tourist-packed mini-vans) who descend on wildlife with little regard for their welfare. By comparison, we rarely encounter other vehicles on the game drives at Mara Plains, an eco-lodge founded by Great Plains Conservation CEO Dereck Joubert. Using low-impact tourism as a source of funding, Great Plains Conservation strives to surround threatened habitats with \"compassionate protection and intelligent management\", supporting a wide range of conservationminded community and global initiatives.\n\n    \"This land belongs to I he wildlife; I here are no fences here.\"\n\n    UNDERTHE STARS Mara Plains Camp is a luxurious eco-lodge located on lands leased from the local Maasai community. The stunning decor provides welcome homey touches, such as a copper claw-foot bath, for guests to enjoy after a day out exploring the wilds.\n\n    Although tents have wi-fi, there's none in the communal gathering areas at Mara Plains Camp, which I absolutely love, because guests are encouraged to interact and immerse themselves in nature.\n\n    Chunky railway sleeper stairs lead from the main lounge area down to straw pathways through the trees to the tents.\n\n    When I unzip my \"tent\", if you can call it that, I'm met with an expanse of lavish style. It's an utterly luxurious place to sleep and I never want to leave.\n\n    Mara Plains provides the perfect surrounds to connect with nature, a mission made easier with the loan of a camera/binocular set. I give the zoom a workout and capture shot after shot of postcard-worthy snaps of lion cubs tussling, a cheetah lazing on the plains and zebras grazing peacefully. Does life get any better than this?\n\n    When we get back to camp, we wrap up in blankets and enjoy a drink by the fire as lightning plays out on the vast plain.\n\n    We dine under the stars at a communal table, the spread of mouthwatering dishes followed by a decadent chocolate fondant.\n\n    The experience is marred only by the distant sound of a wildebeest's dying cries as it becomes prey. \"It was quick,\" Mousley assures us.\n\n    We are so at one with nature here that, after dark, a spear-wielding Maasai warrior must walk guests to and from their tents.\n\n    As I lie in blissful repose in bed that night, I listen to rain and to the honking and snuffling of the hippos that live in the river below. I fall asleep knowing that all around me, nature is going about its business unimpeded, and that's enough to give anyone a sound night's sleep.

KEYWORDS: Lion, Kenya DECOR &amp; TRAVEL: KENYA EDUCATION OFFICER THOMAS THIEPATTHE GIRAFFE CENTRE Giraffes are making a comeback.\n\n    Like many wildlife species in Kenya, Rothschild giraffes are endangered, but a breeding programme in Nairobi is now helping to turn their prospects around, The Giraffe Centre was foum' in 1979 in an effort to reverse the rapidly declining numbers. There are three species of giraffe in Kenya.\n\n    Rothschild giraffes are distinguished by their long, white \"socks\". Thirty years ago, there were only 120 Rothschild giraffes living in Kenya and their remaining habitat was under threat. Thanks to the efforts of the Giraffe Centre and other conservation programmes, there are now more than 600 giraffes living in the wild.\n\n    As well as serving as a breeding centre - male giraffes are released into national parks when they reach two years old - the 48.5-hectare Giraffe Centre was created to educate Nairobi's youth about the need to conserve wildlife. With more than half of Kenya's population living below the poverty line, visiting the game reserves that lie beyond the city just isn't an option. So many children know little to nothing about the animals and landscape that makes their country so special.\n\n    If you'd like to help, a donation of US$10 pays for a local child to take an ecology excursion, visiting the Giraffe Centre, an elephant taking part in this programme, it's the first time they have left their city dwellings. Visiting the Giraffe Centre yourself is another way to lend your support - feeding and interacting with these towering animals is quite the experience.\n\n    Find out more about the programme at giraffecenter.org.\n\nCaption Text:\nThe Giraffe Cet has helped Bring Rothschiltfs gin back frorajrtejjrirtff of extinction in Kenya, jt it still remains an\n\nINTO THE WILD Tourist safari guid are often local tribesmen who have -depth knowle of the native land animals.\nEATING OUT Meals provided area delicious showcase of locally grown fruit and vegetables and much more.\nSAFARI STYLE /\"\"pie accommodation /inwnerses guests completely in the surrounding natural Wnn&gt;ent, from edible views to outdoor dining.</full></item></root>",

The government is unable or unwilling to lay a glove on him.\n\n    With only a couple of exceptions, the Coalition seems reluctant to get into the political ring.\n\n    For the government there is a frightening question: can it recover or does Turnbull face a long road to decline and defeat as Labor controls the terms of debate?\n\n    The Liberal Party has not absorbed the lessons of the election.\n\n    It is indulgent in pursuing the personal interests of MPs, complacent about its position in the House of Representatives, reluctant to pull together in the cause of unity and, so far, singularly unsuccessful in improving its polling position in the country.\n\n    The Prime Minister was reduced yesterday to saying \"we're in office and we're in power\", anxious to kill the converse proposition from taking hold.\n\n    He admitted the government was guilty of \"complacency\" and MPs had done \"the wrong thing\", and said of the ministers and backbenchers who missed the Thursday afternoon votes that they had been embarrassed, humiliated and excoriated - which are remarkable comments from a PM.\n\n    Earlier in the week Turnbull tried to assert himself with some success.

Declaring that Turnbull has already lost the royal commission debate, Shorten asks: \"How can he talk about ordinary people tightening their belts when he will not do anything about the banks?\" The idea of a royal commission now exists in its own right devoid of argument.

The unspoken reality is that anybody who thinks this is merely about the ethical behaviour of banks is a fool.\n\n    Labor, the Greens and the unions are fuelling a furnace of sentiment that will empower largescale changes to the structure of the financial sector at the expense of the banks.

Turnbull said yesterday Pyne had \"made it very clear that he gave nobody permission to leave\".\n\n    The government whips were clueless. The ministers and backbenchers who left are culpable but there was a collective failure as the Liberals misread the nature of the parliament. What a blunder for the opening week! Interviewed by The Australian, manager of opposition business Tony Burke said: \"As far as the Turnbull government is concerned I don't think it can make it beyond the halfway point of this term. I don't know whether the partyroom or the parliament will move first.\" Labor's effort to generate the impression of a divided and unstable government has won fresh momentum.\n\n    Burke has famously declared \"the clock is ticking\" on Turnbull.\n\n    The risk for Turnbull is that instability can be self-fulfilling.\n\n    The moral and political momentum for a royal commission would have gained immeasurable weight had both houses passed such a resolution. As opposition Treasury spokesman Chris Bowen said, a resolution would have been an instruction to Turnbull: \"This is what we want you to do.\" Turnbull would have defied it, but only at significant cost.\n\n    Labor's campaign was relentless all week. This is a populist issue but far transcends populism.\n\n    In truth, it is about political and financial power in Australia. But Labor, assisted by the media, successfully depicts it as a moral and justice issue for the people. The optics are brilliant, the real issues concealed.\n\n    Shorten put a royal commission resolution to the house on Wednesday morning and lost.\n\n    Speaking to the motion, he accused Turnbull and his government of \"running a protection racket to protect the big banks of Australia\". Shorten uses the bank issue to discredit Turnbull's standing as leader: \"You can take Malcolm Turnbull out of the investment bank but you cannot take the investment bank out of Malcolm Turnbull.\" Labor's campaign to depict Turnbull as a PM for the big end of town who cannot relate to ordinary Australians is entrenched. The bank campaign has a dual function.\n\n    Shorten said the essential purpose of the royal commission was Continued on Page 18 Labor can smell the Coalition's vulnerability.

He offered five initial objectives: to find how widespread were the unethical and illegal practices; to find how banks treated their customers; to identify how bank culture and business structures drove the behaviour of the institutions; to assess whether the regulators were up to the job; and to review the lessons from international experience.\n\n    Declaring that Australians \"are fed up with the conduct of their banks\", Shorten made clear this campaign would continue until Labor achieved its purpose. After losing the vote, Shorten then asked the Prime Minister in his first question of the new parliament when Turnbull \"would stop protecting the banks\". In his first motion of public importance he denounced Turnbull as a \"coward\" who had \"no authority and no agenda\".\n\n    Turnbull replied to Shorten's opening question with real fire. He seemed to shock his own benches as he denounced Shorten as a \"latter-day Jack Lang\" and proceeded to a charge with lethal potential: that Shorten was not interested in the people hard done by the banks but was merely exploiting their grievances for his own political gain.\n\n    \"He has not offered to recover one dollar,\" Turnbull said. \"He had not offered to change one law.\n\n    What he has offered to do is spend years and years on a lawyers' funding fest. When he had the levers of power in his hand, what did he do?\n\n    Nothing. Last year what did they do when a royal commission was proposed? Nothing.\" The next day the Senate carried a resolution calling for a royal commission with a clause saying the motion would return to the house. Yet the government was caught napping. At 4.16pm in the house, Labor sought to put the issue back on the agenda in a sequence that saw the government lose three procedural motions.\n\n    \"There is a pathology in our banking and financial services system which is sick,\" Shorten said during these dramas. After Scott Morrison branded Labor's royal commission a \"stunt\" for \"which they have no terms of reference\", Shorten declared: \"We will never, never, never give up seeking justice for the victims of banks and financial services. We will never, never, never give up seeking a banking royal commission.\" He branded the government \"cowards and defenders for malfeasance in the financial sector\".\n\n    Shorten said he would never accept the proposition \"that the only way our banks can be successful is by leaving a trail of misery\".\n\n    He said the cost borne by thousands of victims was measured in divorce, anxiety and depression.\n\n    The common victims were farmers and small-business people. The Liberals, he said, \"represent the seedy end of financial planning\".\n\n    \"We may succeed tonight or we may not,\" Shorten said. He was putting the government on notice that Labor saw the royal commission as the \"last resort, long overdue, for justice for a generation of people\" - an entire generation of fellow Australians \"who have been mistreated and let down by the system\".\n\n    Labor ridicules the extraordinary succession of fallback plans announced by the Turnbull government in recent weeks to stem the tide for a royal commission strengthening the regulator, hauling bank chiefs before a parliamentary committee, creating a tribunal, and now having the small-business Ombudsman probe unconscionable conduct.\n\n    Turnbull must know it's time for the fallbacks to end. The sense of desperation is transparent and absurd.\n\n    The populist Right and the full spectrum of progressive politics want the royal commission. While they are presumably serious about helping people, the real motive for this proposal lies in political advantage and reducing the power and role of banks in the financial system.\n\n    Turnbull showed earlier on Thursday flashes of a retaliatory campaign that might offer hope for the government. As Labor questioned him about the plight of an individual bank victim named Michelle, Turnbull asked just how a royal commission would help Michelle.\n\n    \"What is that going to do?\" he asked. \"Will that pay her back? No.\n\n    She will get nothing. She has a debt and she needs to find some financial compensation. She needs to seek justice. What we have in place are ombudsman services. We have legal services. We have a range of avenues she can employ.\" There is no point Turnbull defending the banks. The banks must look after themselves. But there is point in Turnbull asking how a royal commission will actually assist the victims. It might even provide an insight into Australian scepticism about the grand ideas of politicians. The concept for the royal commission originated in politics but its consequences will be far-reaching for the financial system. Beneath the drama on Thursday afternoon in parliament the real story lay elsewhere - it is the joined populist and power struggle over the banking system.</full></item></root>",

His total pay packet was up 9 per cent on the prior year's $11.9m.\n\n    For the entire executive group the Qantas annual report revealed remuneration totalling $29.2m and total cash bonuses of $7.7m.\n\n    The short-term cash rewards were up $3m on the comparable number last year.\n\n    Qantas chairman Leigh Clifford defended the healthy bonus payments, noting shareholders had been rewarded through $1.5bn in buybacks and dividends, while non-executive employees received bonuses at the end of each of the last two financial years.\n\n    This year the airline paid 25,000 staff cash bonuses between $2500 and $3000, in addition to a 5 per cent bonus paid last year for staff who agreed to an 18-month pay freeze.\n\n    \"When Qantas was not performing well financially, no bonuses were given, all executive salaries were frozen and the CEO took a pay cut,\" Mr Clifford said.\n\n    \"As the company has moved through its transformation the financial performance has turned around, we are able to reward our people.\" Mr Clifford labelled the turnaround in fortunes of the group a \"major achievement\", culminating in a record $1.52 billion profit for the 2016 financial year.\n\n    The company also resumed dividend payments for the first time in seven years, rewarding patient shareholders with a 7c payout.\n\n    Since the end of the 2014 financial year Qantas has also seen its share price recover from $1.35 to $3.26, which drove a big increase in total shareholder return.\n\n    The Qantas annual report reveals its remuneration committee last year considered a number of alternative long term incentive plan performance measures, such as return on invested capital.\n\n    But it decided the current measure of the airline's TSR compared to companies in the ASX100 and Global Listed Airlines remained the most appropriate measure.\n\n    Mr Joyce's base pay was $2.1m, slightly above last year as a 5 per cent pay cut he made in January 2014 was reinstated.\n\n    His cash bonus of $3.3m took his total actual cash payments in the hand last year to $5.4m. In addition he was awarded a deferred bonus of $1.6m worth of shares with a two-year restriction period.\n\n    The bonuses were based on a number of internal measures, including the delivery of higher than budgeted cost savings and revenue enhancements in 2015-16.\n\n    Net promoter score targets for customer service for Qantas International, Qantas Domestic and Qantas Frequent Flyer were also exceeded. They were not achieved by Jetstar Domestic.\n\n    Under the 2014-2016 LTIP, a fixed number of rights were awarded to the executive team in 2013. Based on Qantas's TSR of +109 per cent over the three-year performance period, the rights all converted to shares.\n\n    As a result Mr Joyce was awarded 2.1 million shares. After the Qantas share price rise, their $2.9m value in mid 2013 has now increased by $3.1m, taking his total cash and shares package to almost $13m.\n\n    Qantas also revealed yesterday that Mr Joyce sold the 2.1 million shares that vested, which is understood to be for tax reasons due to the liability attached to them.\n\n    As the company has moved through its transformation the financial performance has turned around, we are able to reward our people.\n\n    LEIGH CLIFFORD, QANTAS</full></item></root>",

His total pay packet was up 9 per cent on the prior year's $11.9m.\r\n\r\n    For the entire executive group the Qantas annual report revealed remuneration totalling $29.2m and total cash bonuses of $7.7m.\r\n\r\n    The short-term cash rewards were up $3m on the comparable number last year.\r\n\r\n    Qantas chairman Leigh Clifford defended the healthy bonus payments, noting shareholders had been rewarded through $1.5bn in buybacks and dividends, while non-executive employees received bonuses at the end of each of the last two financial years.\r\n\r\n    This year the airline paid 25,000 staff cash bonuses between $2500 and $3000, in addition to a 5 per cent bonus paid last year for staff who agreed to an 18-month pay freeze.\r\n\r\n    \"When Qantas was not performing well financially, no bonuses were given, all executive salaries were frozen and the CEO took a pay cut,\" Mr Clifford said.\r\n\r\n    \"As the company has moved through its transformation the financial performance has turned around, we are able to reward our people.\" Mr Clifford labelled the turnaround in fortunes of the group a \"major achievement\", culminating in a record $1.52 billion profit for the 2016 financial year.\r\n\r\n    The company also resumed dividend payments for the first time in seven years, rewarding patient shareholders with a 7c payout.\r\n\r\n    Since the end of the 2014 financial year Qantas has also seen its share price recover from $1.35 to $3.26, which drove a big increase in total shareholder return.\r\n\r\n    The Qantas annual report reveals its remuneration committee last year considered a number of alternative long term incentive plan performance measures, such as return on invested capital.\r\n\r\n    But it decided the current measure of the airline's TSR compared to companies in the ASX100 and Global Listed Airlines remained the most appropriate measure.\r\n\r\n    Mr Joyce's base pay was $2.1m, slightly above last year as a 5 per cent pay cut he made in January 2014 was reinstated.\r\n\r\n    His cash bonus of $3.3m took his total actual cash payments in the hand last year to $5.4m. In addition he was awarded a deferred bonus of $1.6m worth of shares with a two-year restriction period.\r\n\r\n    The bonuses were based on a number of internal measures, including the delivery of higher than budgeted cost savings and revenue enhancements in 2015-16.\r\n\r\n    Net promoter score targets for customer service for Qantas International, Qantas Domestic and Qantas Frequent Flyer were also exceeded. They were not achieved by Jetstar Domestic.\r\n\r\n    Under the 2014-2016 LTIP, a fixed number of rights were awarded to the executive team in 2013. Based on Qantas's TSR of +109 per cent over the three-year performance period, the rights all converted to shares.\r\n\r\n    As a result Mr Joyce was awarded 2.1 million shares. After the Qantas share price rise, their $2.9m value in mid 2013 has now increased by $3.1m, taking his total cash and shares package to almost $13m.\r\n\r\n    Qantas also revealed yesterday that Mr Joyce sold the 2.1 million shares that vested, which is understood to be for tax reasons due to the liability attached to them.\r\n\r\n    As the company has moved through its transformation the financial performance has turned around, we are able to reward our people.\r\n\r\n    LEIGH CLIFFORD, QANTAS",

Time to move on.\" The banks know that.\r\n\r\nCaption Text:\r\nAAP Labor MPs discuss tactics after the new government lost several votes in the House of Representatives this week",

The colour is new. Her clothes are new. Even the laugh feels new.\n\n    Before, when she wanted to dye her hair, go to movies, or get a massage, Beth was told she couldn't afford it, that she didn't have money, she says. But actually, she did.\n\n    The Financial Ombudsman has ordered the Commonwealth Bank to pay back more than $84,000 to the 28-year-old, after it allowed her mother to regularly withdraw money, over nine years, from her daughter's account.\n\n    Beth, who has cerebral palsy and epilepsy, was not aware she had a bank account.

A lack of such stringent measures at one port puts the whole state at risk.\" Tasmanian Farmers and Graziers Association (TFGA) president Wayne Johnston also said screening should be more consistent.\r\n\r\n    \"You would hope that every person coming into Tasmania would have some sort of screening process done,\" he said.\r\n\r\n    \"I know it's not possibly happening and the moment but that's what we should be aiming for.\" But Minister Rockliff this week defended his government's biosecurity measures at Burnie airport.\r\n\r\n    \"Flights into Wynyard (Burnie) airport are regularly met by biosecurity officers and also detector dog teams, and upgraded signage and amnesty bins are provided the same as other airports,\" he said.\r\n\r\n    \"The recently-expanded detector dog teams will rotate around the smaller airports such as Wynyard (Burnie), Flinders and King Island.\" Mr Rockliff added Biosecurity Tasmania regularly reviews biosecurity measures to reflect the level of risk at each port. In the case of Burnie airport, he said the risk has been assessed to be low.\r\n\r\n    \"Wynyard (Burnie) airport is currently considered a lower biosecurity risk relative to some other entry points, based on the history of the quantity of fruit and vegetables seized, and on the small number of passengers using the facility,\" he said.\r\n\r\nCaption Text:\r\nBEEF UP: Braddon MHR Justine Keay has called for an investigation of biosecurity measures at Burnie airport.",

Emmaline started to suffer from excruciating and debilitating pain.\n\n    After the birth of her daughter by caesarean on February 6, 2014, she learned the cause: Emmaline had terminal cancer. Battling the cancer would be made worse, when she asked her bank, BankWest, owned by the Commonwealth Bank, for hardship assistance with their home loan.\n\n    \"It wasn't a large mortgage (about $170,000) . . .\n\n    however, it did represent a significant ongoing cost at a time when our lives and our finances were being turned upside down,\" Rainer Mathews told BusinessDay.\n\n    Mathews is one of many of BankWest customers who say they have been treated poorly by the bank and its owner CBA.\n\n    In the case of the Mathews, weeks after Emmaline was diagnosed as terminally ill, the bank denied their application for hardship assistance, saying they didn't meet the criteria.\n\n    Mathews applied a second time.\n\n    This time his request was accepted, but only for three months.\n\n    \"During those reapplication times we would be deluged with letters, phone calls, automated voice messages and text messages from the bank,\" he says.\n\n    About 10 months after Emmaline's diagnosis, Mathews was told he would no longer be given any financial help.\n\n    The bank forced him to pay back all outstanding ar rears and return to paying full regular monthly repay ments.\n\n    In the final months of Emmaline's life Mathews had to find work to help pay the bills. In 2015, Emmaline's cancer symptoms escalated quickly.\n\n    She died on June 1.\n\n    \"[What] saddens me the most is that the threat of losing our house weighed heavily on my wife in her time of crisis.\" Mathews says.\n\n    CBA's general manager of retail, Andrew Whitechurch, did not comment directly on the Mathews case when contacted by BusinessDay. But he said he was always seeking to improve policies around how the bank communicates with customers.\n\n    \"When customers face financial difficulties, our overriding priority is to work closely with them on a case-by-case basis to improve their financial position,\" he says.\n\n    Stories like the Mathews' have become all too common in recent years, fuelling public outrage against the banks.\n\n    This year CBA and its practices were put under the microscope when a powerful joint parliamentary committee, chaired by Liberal senator David Fawcett, examined its handling of loan impairments.\n\n    At its BankWest subsidiary, which it bought in 2007, the committee noted a \"culture of placing profit and return to shareholders ahead of the interests of borrowers\".\n\n    CBA is not alone in facing the spotlight. There's been a string of financial planning scandals at Continues Page 29\n\n    Anger, angst drive commission calls From Page 27 other banks including NAB and Macquarie, and allegations of bank bill swap rate rigging at the major banks. All this has fuelled calls for a banking royal commission.\n\n    This week the Labor opposition used the opening session of Parliament - and its fractious closing session - to reaffirm its commitment to a royal commission.\n\n    \"We have seen a string of scandals and rip-offs and rorts, and all we get are smirks and protection conduct from the frontbench of the Turnbull government,\" Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told Parliament. \"There have been thousands denied life insurance payments, elderly Australians robbed of their retirement savings, small investors ripped off by predatory lending and business loans forged and manipulated.\"\n\n    The Turnbull government's response this week to win over some of its backbenchers was to announce another inquiry. This inquiry, headed by Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell, will have the power to forensically analyse \"questionable banking practices\" and conduct hearings.\n\n    But there are caveats. It will only look at small-business lending and it won't be open to everyone.\n\n    The tribunal is no good for cases like the Mathews family. Because their case was not part of a parliamentary joint committee their treatment at the hands of BankWest is outside its scope.\n\n    The Carnell tribunal will run for 12 weeks, with its interim findings to feed into the Ramsay Review, an examination - chaired by Melbourne University's Professor Ian Ramsay - of the various external dispute resolution bodies dealing with customer complaints against financial services operators.\n\n    These are just two of the measures unveiled by the Coalition government in recent months. It has already boosted the funding of the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, while promising to beef up its powers and the penalties.\n\n    Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer, who announced the new inquiry on Wednesday, has argued a royal commission would only go over old ground, delay reforms already in the pipeline and undermine the standing of Australia's banks thereby putting at risk the nation's AAA credit rating.\n\n    The new small business loan inquiry announced during the week managed to calm those stirring on the issue on the government's backbench. Among them is Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who in April called for a full royal commission \"into the profit-driven and immoral activities of the big banks\".\n\n    He believes last week's inquiry was \"a start to a good outcome\" but he would eventually like to see a beefed-up complaints-handling body to give victims more clout when taking on the big banks.\n\n    It isn't the first time banks have been in the firing line for a royal commission.\n\n    In 2013, Fairfax Media revealed a scandal inside CBA's financial planning division, where financial planners including star planner Don Nguyen were caught ploughing millions of dollars of their clients money into high-risk, high feepaying CBA products, which resulted in financial devastation for thousands of people.\n\n    There were allegations of systemic wrongdoing in the division, including forgery, fraud and a cover up by management.\n\n    The Senate inquiry, chaired by now retired senator Mark Bishop, didn't believe ASIC was capable of investigating the bank's advice arm. It was shown to be \"a timid, hesitant regulator, too ready and willing to accept uncritically the assurances of a large institution that there were no grounds for ASIC's concerns or intervention\".\n\n    CBA apologised and opened up a compensation scheme for bank customers. But even today, Bob Nissen, a victim of financial misconduct, is still waiting to have his file finalised.\n\n    In 2006 Nissen invested his money with disgraced financial planner Rollo Sherriff, who was then operating under CBA's Financial Wisdom umbrella.\n\n    Nissen, who is a carer for his schizophrenic daughter Karen, had his life savings destroyed when Sherriff put him into high-risk CBA investments that were geared up to the hilt.\n\n    Nissen was advised to remortgage his house and take out CBA loans to fund the investments. His daughter was also a victim of Sherriff's advice.\n\n    The investments turned sour in 2009, forcing Nissen, who was 67 at the time, to find work as a mine worker on seven-day shifts at Cloncurry, near Mount Isa.\n\n    Sherriff was eventually exposed by Fairfax Media in 2014. He was never banned by ASIC, despite ploughing about $750,000 of his clients' money into his own private venture and costing the Commonwealth Bank about $7 million in initial compensation.\n\n    Nissen received compensation and signed a settlement deed in November 2012.\n\n    After Sherriff was exposed, CBA re-opened its compensation program. Nissen, who had to quit his mining job and gone on the pension, lodged another claim under the CBA's Open Advice Review Program for about $160,000. He believes his daughter is owed $40,000. He is still waiting and says the bank still hasn't finalised his request.\n\n    Leif Gamertsfelder, manager of the bank's advice review program, says Nissen's claim was \"well progressed\". He says the CBA has worked hard to resolve customers' concerns.\n\n    Bishop, the former Labor senator who was part of the landmark inquiry into ASIC's performance that called for a royal commission, says such an inquiry is more necessary than ever.\n\n    \"The original inquiry called for a holistic approach to the issues,\" he says. \"It is that holistic approach that is being frustrated by the government, which is offering a piecemeal, uncoordinated approach.\"\n\n    A royal commission would also address shortfalls in protections for corporate whistleblowers. The banking industry's lobby group, the Australian Bankers Association, has promised to improve the treatment of whistleblowers, part of a suite of measures announced in April.\n\n    The banks said they would work with regulators to \"ensure the highest standards of whistleblower protections by ensuring there is a robust and trusted framework for escalating concerns\".\n\n    But Bishop and others believe stronger external protections for whistleblowers are needed. The biggest scandals that have hit the financial services sector were exposed by internal whistleblowers.\n\n    An investigation by Fairfax Media into IOOF exposed allegations of serious misconduct, insider trading, front running, cheating by senior staff and the misrepresentation of performance numbers for its funds.\n\n    The IOOF whistleblower said the way ASIC handled the investigation should be a call to arms for a royal commission.\n\n    He sent the regulator 59,000 documents and offered to help.\n\n    ASIC interviewed him for 35 minutes, which shocked him.\n\n    He said after 12 months ASIC produced a one-page press release that summed up its investigations and recommendations.\n\n    The press release identified a number of serious concerns in IOOF's research division including compliance arrangements, breach reporting, management of conflicts of interest, staff trading policy, disclosure, whistleblower management and protection and cyber security. Despite these findings, outlined in the press release, IOOF wasn't subjected to fines, sanctions, a banning order, enforceable undertaking or licence conditions amended.\n\n    \"What was the point of the investigation when they are not accountable and there is no transparency,\" he says.\n\n    Jeff Morris, a CBA whistleblower who called out wrongdoing in CBA's financial advice division, particularly star planner Don Nguyen, says the case for a royal commission into the banks has been made many times over.\n\n    Romesh Wijeyeratn worked for ASIC and the Commonwealth Bank. He's also given evidence at the parliamentary joint committee which led to the announcement of this week's inquiry.\n\n    He described O'Dwyer's inquiry as \"window dressing\" to avoid addressing the deeper systemic issues in the financial sector.\n\n    \"Up until today I was giving Malcolm [Turnbull] the benefit of the doubt,\" he says. \"I thought maybe he was genuinely looking for a way to fix the banks.\"\n\n    Rainer Mathews is still grieving for the loss of his wife. In March this year he wrote to the industryfunded Financial Ombudsman Service - one of the bodies under review by the Ramsay-led panel complaining about BankWest's behaviour.\n\n    \"I wanted the bank to look at the way that it had treated us, offer an apology and review its policies and procedures into the way it deals with hardship assistance for families facing, a terminal illness,\" Mathews says.\n\n    In June this year, two months after lodging the claim, FOS responded. It told Mathews that BankWest had acted appropriately. \"It insisted that the way we had been treated was the norm, not an anomaly,\" he says.\n\n    There's been a string of financial planning scandals at banks.\n\n    Royal Commission positions What they said this week \"We will never, never, never give up seeking justice for the victims of banks and financial services. We will never, never give up seeking a banking royal commission.\" Opposition leader Bill Shorten \"The work the government is already undertaking will provide ongoing scrutiny, greater resourcing and a stronger regulator, instead of a one-off, time-consuming and expensive royal commission\" Kelly O'Dwyer revenue and financial services minister \"If a royal commission were to go ahead it would simply be reviewing old ground and would delay welldeveloped and important reforms.\" George Christensen Coalition MP and former royal commission advocate \"It is clear from the breadth and scope of the allegations that the problems in this industry go beyond any one bank, type of financial institution or group of receivers a royal commission [is] the only forum with the coercive powers and broad jurisdiction necessary to properly perform this investigation.\" Part of motion put to the house of representatives by Labor, seconded by independent Bob Katter.\n\nCaption Text:\nPrime minister Malcolm Turnbull.\nRainer Mathews and wife Emmaline were initially denied hardship assistance by their bank.

"fulltext": "\r\n    The Turnbull government's measures have failed to ease anger over how many banks behave, writes Mario Christodoulou.\r\n\r\n    The year 2014 should have been a happy one for Emmaline and Rainer Mathews, who were expecting their second child.\r\n\r\n    But in the final month of the pregnancy something went terribly wrong. Emmaline started to suffer from excruciating and debilitating pain.\r\n\r\n    After the birth of her daughter by caesarean on February 6, 2014, she learned the cause: Emmaline had terminal cancer. Battling the cancer would be made worse, when she asked her bank, BankWest, owned by the Commonwealth Bank, for hardship assistance with their home loan.\r\n\r\n    \"It wasn't a large mortgage (about $170,000) . . .\r\n\r\n    however, it did represent a significant ongoing cost at a time when our lives and our finances were being turned upside down,\" Rainer Mathews told BusinessDay.\r\n\r\n    Mathews is one of many of BankWest customers who say they have been treated poorly by the bank and its owner CBA.\r\n\r\n    In the case of the Mathews, weeks after Emmaline was diagnosed as terminally ill, the bank denied their application for hardship assistance, saying they didn't meet the criteria.\r\n\r\n    Mathews applied a second time.\r\n\r\n    This time his request was accepted, but only for three months.\r\n\r\n    \"During those reapplication times we would be deluged with letters, phone calls, automated voice messages and text messages from the bank,\" he says.\r\n\r\n    About 10 months after Emmaline's diagnosis, Mathews was told he would no longer be given any financial help.\r\n\r\n    The bank forced him to pay back all outstanding ar rears and return to paying full regular monthly repay ments.\r\n\r\n    In the final months of Emmaline's life Mathews had to find work to help pay the bills. In 2015, Emmaline's cancer symptoms escalated quickly.\r\n\r\n    She died on June 1.\r\n\r\n    \"[What] saddens me the most is that the threat of losing our house weighed heavily on my wife in her time of crisis.\" Mathews says.\r\n\r\n    CBA's general manager of retail, Andrew Whitechurch, did not comment directly on the Mathews case when contacted by BusinessDay. But he said he was always seeking to improve policies around how the bank communicates with customers.\r\n\r\n    \"When customers face financial difficulties, our overriding priority is to work closely with them on a case-by-case basis to improve their financial position,\" he says.\r\n\r\n    Stories like the Mathews' have become all too common in recent years, fuelling public outrage against the banks.\r\n\r\n    This year CBA and its practices were put under the microscope when a powerful joint parliamentary committee, chaired by Liberal senator David Fawcett, examined its handling of loan impairments.\r\n\r\n    At its BankWest subsidiary, which it bought in 2007, the committee noted a \"culture of placing profit and return to shareholders ahead of the interests of borrowers\".\r\n\r\n    CBA is not alone in facing the spotlight. There's been a string of financial planning scandals at Continues Page 29\r\n\r\n    Anger, angst drive commission calls From Page 27 other banks including NAB and Macquarie, and allegations of bank bill swap rate rigging at the major banks. All this has fuelled calls for a banking royal commission.\r\n\r\n    This week the Labor opposition used the opening session of Parliament - and its fractious closing session - to reaffirm its commitment to a royal commission.\r\n\r\n    \"We have seen a string of scandals and rip-offs and rorts, and all we get are smirks and protection conduct from the frontbench of the Turnbull government,\" Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told Parliament. \"There have been thousands denied life insurance payments, elderly Australians robbed of their retirement savings, small investors ripped off by predatory lending and business loans forged and manipulated.\"\r\n\r\n    The Turnbull government's response this week to win over some of its backbenchers was to announce another inquiry. This inquiry, headed by Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell, will have the power to forensically analyse \"questionable banking practices\" and conduct hearings.\r\n\r\n    But there are caveats. It will only look at small-business lending and it won't be open to everyone.\r\n\r\n    The tribunal is no good for cases like the Mathews family. Because their case was not part of a parliamentary joint committee their treatment at the hands of BankWest is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n    The Carnell tribunal will run for 12 weeks, with its interim findings to feed into the Ramsay Review, an examination - chaired by Melbourne University's Professor Ian Ramsay - of the various external dispute resolution bodies dealing with customer complaints against financial services operators.\r\n\r\n    These are just two of the measures unveiled by the Coalition government in recent months. It has already boosted the funding of the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, while promising to beef up its powers and the penalties.\r\n\r\n    Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer, who announced the new inquiry on Wednesday, has argued a royal commission would only go over old ground, delay reforms already in the pipeline and undermine the standing of Australia's banks thereby putting at risk the nation's AAA credit rating.\r\n\r\n    The new small business loan inquiry announced during the week managed to calm those stirring on the issue on the government's backbench. Among them is Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who in April called for a full royal commission \"into the profit-driven and immoral activities of the big banks\".\r\n\r\n    He believes last week's inquiry was \"a start to a good outcome\" but he would eventually like to see a beefed-up complaints-handling body to give victims more clout when taking on the big banks.\r\n\r\n    It isn't the first time banks have been in the firing line for a royal commission.\r\n\r\n    In 2013, Fairfax Media revealed a scandal inside CBA's financial planning division, where financial planners including star planner Don Nguyen were caught ploughing millions of dollars of their clients money into high-risk, high feepaying CBA products, which resulted in financial devastation for thousands of people.\r\n\r\n    There were allegations of systemic wrongdoing in the division, including forgery, fraud and a cover up by management.\r\n\r\n    The Senate inquiry, chaired by now retired senator Mark Bishop, didn't believe ASIC was capable of investigating the bank's advice arm. It was shown to be \"a timid, hesitant regulator, too ready and willing to accept uncritically the assurances of a large institution that there were no grounds for ASIC's concerns or intervention\".\r\n\r\n    CBA apologised and opened up a compensation scheme for bank customers. But even today, Bob Nissen, a victim of financial misconduct, is still waiting to have his file finalised.\r\n\r\n    In 2006 Nissen invested his money with disgraced financial planner Rollo Sherriff, who was then operating under CBA's Financial Wisdom umbrella.\r\n\r\n    Nissen, who is a carer for his schizophrenic daughter Karen, had his life savings destroyed when Sherriff put him into high-risk CBA investments that were geared up to the hilt.\r\n\r\n    Nissen was advised to remortgage his house and take out CBA loans to fund the investments. His daughter was also a victim of Sherriff's advice.\r\n\r\n    The investments turned sour in 2009, forcing Nissen, who was 67 at the time, to find work as a mine worker on seven-day shifts at Cloncurry, near Mount Isa.\r\n\r\n    Sherriff was eventually exposed by Fairfax Media in 2014. He was never banned by ASIC, despite ploughing about $750,000 of his clients' money into his own private venture and costing the Commonwealth Bank about $7 million in initial compensation.\r\n\r\n    Nissen received compensation and signed a settlement deed in November 2012.\r\n\r\n    After Sherriff was exposed, CBA re-opened its compensation program. Nissen, who had to quit his mining job and gone on the pension, lodged another claim under the CBA's Open Advice Review Program for about $160,000. He believes his daughter is owed $40,000. He is still waiting and says the bank still hasn't finalised his request.\r\n\r\n    Leif Gamertsfelder, manager of the bank's advice review program, says Nissen's claim was \"well progressed\". He says the CBA has worked hard to resolve customers' concerns.\r\n\r\n    Bishop, the former Labor senator who was part of the landmark inquiry into ASIC's performance that called for a royal commission, says such an inquiry is more necessary than ever.\r\n\r\n    \"The original inquiry called for a holistic approach to the issues,\" he says. \"It is that holistic approach that is being frustrated by the government, which is offering a piecemeal, uncoordinated approach.\"\r\n\r\n    A royal commission would also address shortfalls in protections for corporate whistleblowers.

"fulltext": "\r\n    The Turnbull government's measures have failed to ease anger over how many banks behave, writes Mario Christodoulou.\r\n\r\n    The year 2014 should have been a happy one for Emmaline and Rainer Mathews, who were expecting their second child.\r\n\r\n    But in the final month of the pregnancy something went terribly wrong. Emmaline started to suffer from excruciating and debilitating pain.\r\n\r\n    After the birth of her daughter by caesarean on February 6, 2014, she learned the cause: Emmaline had terminal cancer. Battling the cancer would be made worse, when she asked her bank, BankWest, owned by the Commonwealth Bank, for hardship assistance with their home loan.\r\n\r\n    \"It wasn't a large mortgage (about $170,000) . . .\r\n\r\n    however, it did represent a significant ongoing cost at a time when our lives and our finances were being turned upside down,\" Rainer Mathews told BusinessDay.\r\n\r\n    Mathews is one of many of BankWest customers who say they have been treated poorly by the bank and its owner CBA.\r\n\r\n    In the case of the Mathews, weeks after Emmaline was diagnosed as terminally ill, the bank denied their application for hardship assistance, saying they didn't meet the criteria.\r\n\r\n    Mathews applied a second time.\r\n\r\n    This time his request was accepted, but only for three months.\r\n\r\n    \"During those reapplication times we would be deluged with letters, phone calls, automated voice messages and text messages from the bank,\" he says.\r\n\r\n    About 10 months after Emmaline's diagnosis, Mathews was told he would no longer be given any financial help.\r\n\r\n    The bank forced him to pay back all outstanding ar rears and return to paying full regular monthly repay ments.\r\n\r\n    In the final months of Emmaline's life Mathews had to find work to help pay the bills. In 2015, Emmaline's cancer symptoms escalated quickly.\r\n\r\n    She died on June 1.\r\n\r\n    \"[What] saddens me the most is that the threat of losing our house weighed heavily on my wife in her time of crisis.\" Mathews says.\r\n\r\n    CBA's general manager of retail, Andrew Whitechurch, did not comment directly on the Mathews case when contacted by BusinessDay. But he said he was always seeking to improve policies around how the bank communicates with customers.\r\n\r\n    \"When customers face financial difficulties, our overriding priority is to work closely with them on a case-by-case basis to improve their financial position,\" he says.\r\n\r\n    Stories like the Mathews' have become all too common in recent years, fuelling public outrage against the banks.\r\n\r\n    This year CBA and its practices were put under the microscope when a powerful joint parliamentary committee, chaired by Liberal senator David Fawcett, examined its handling of loan impairments.\r\n\r\n    At its BankWest subsidiary, which it bought in 2007, the committee noted a \"culture of placing profit and return to shareholders ahead of the interests of borrowers\".\r\n\r\n    CBA is not alone in facing the spotlight. There's been a string of financial planning scandals at Continues Page 29\r\n\r\n    Anger, angst drive commission calls From Page 27 other banks including NAB and Macquarie, and allegations of bank bill swap rate rigging at the major banks. All this has fuelled calls for a banking royal commission.\r\n\r\n    This week the Labor opposition used the opening session of Parliament - and its fractious closing session - to reaffirm its commitment to a royal commission.\r\n\r\n    \"We have seen a string of scandals and rip-offs and rorts, and all we get are smirks and protection conduct from the frontbench of the Turnbull government,\" Opposition Leader Bill Shorten told Parliament. \"There have been thousands denied life insurance payments, elderly Australians robbed of their retirement savings, small investors ripped off by predatory lending and business loans forged and manipulated.\"\r\n\r\n    The Turnbull government's response this week to win over some of its backbenchers was to announce another inquiry. This inquiry, headed by Australian Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman Kate Carnell, will have the power to forensically analyse \"questionable banking practices\" and conduct hearings.\r\n\r\n    But there are caveats. It will only look at small-business lending and it won't be open to everyone.\r\n\r\n    The tribunal is no good for cases like the Mathews family. Because their case was not part of a parliamentary joint committee their treatment at the hands of BankWest is outside its scope.\r\n\r\n    The Carnell tribunal will run for 12 weeks, with its interim findings to feed into the Ramsay Review, an examination - chaired by Melbourne University's Professor Ian Ramsay - of the various external dispute resolution bodies dealing with customer complaints against financial services operators.\r\n\r\n    These are just two of the measures unveiled by the Coalition government in recent months. It has already boosted the funding of the corporate regulator, the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, while promising to beef up its powers and the penalties.\r\n\r\n    Financial Services Minister Kelly O'Dwyer, who announced the new inquiry on Wednesday, has argued a royal commission would only go over old ground, delay reforms already in the pipeline and undermine the standing of Australia's banks thereby putting at risk the nation's AAA credit rating.\r\n\r\n    The new small business loan inquiry announced during the week managed to calm those stirring on the issue on the government's backbench. Among them is Liberal MP Warren Entsch, who in April called for a full royal commission \"into the profit-driven and immoral activities of the big banks\".\r\n\r\n    He believes last week's inquiry was \"a start to a good outcome\" but he would eventually like to see a beefed-up complaints-handling body to give victims more clout when taking on the big banks.\r\n\r\n    It isn't the first time banks have been in the firing line for a royal commission.\r\n\r\n    In 2013, Fairfax Media revealed a scandal inside CBA's financial planning division, where financial planners including star planner Don Nguyen were caught ploughing millions of dollars of their clients money into high-risk, high feepaying CBA products, which resulted in financial devastation for thousands of people.\r\n\r\n    There were allegations of systemic wrongdoing in the division, including forgery, fraud and a cover up by management.\r\n\r\n    The Senate inquiry, chaired by now retired senator Mark Bishop, didn't believe ASIC was capable of investigating the bank's advice arm. It was shown to be \"a timid, hesitant regulator, too ready and willing to accept uncritically the assurances of a large institution that there were no grounds for ASIC's concerns or intervention\".\r\n\r\n    CBA apologised and opened up a compensation scheme for bank customers. But even today, Bob Nissen, a victim of financial misconduct, is still waiting to have his file finalised.\r\n\r\n    In 2006 Nissen invested his money with disgraced financial planner Rollo Sherriff, who was then operating under CBA's Financial Wisdom umbrella.\r\n\r\n    Nissen, who is a carer for his schizophrenic daughter Karen, had his life savings destroyed when Sherriff put him into high-risk CBA investments that were geared up to the hilt.\r\n\r\n    Nissen was advised to remortgage his house and take out CBA loans to fund the investments. His daughter was also a victim of Sherriff's advice.\r\n\r\n    The investments turned sour in 2009, forcing Nissen, who was 67 at the time, to find work as a mine worker on seven-day shifts at Cloncurry, near Mount Isa.\r\n\r\n    Sherriff was eventually exposed by Fairfax Media in 2014. He was never banned by ASIC, despite ploughing about $750,000 of his clients' money into his own private venture and costing the Commonwealth Bank about $7 million in initial compensation.\r\n\r\n    Nissen received compensation and signed a settlement deed in November 2012.\r\n\r\n    After Sherriff was exposed, CBA re-opened its compensation program. Nissen, who had to quit his mining job and gone on the pension, lodged another claim under the CBA's Open Advice Review Program for about $160,000. He believes his daughter is owed $40,000. He is still waiting and says the bank still hasn't finalised his request.\r\n\r\n    Leif Gamertsfelder, manager of the bank's advice review program, says Nissen's claim was \"well progressed\". He says the CBA has worked hard to resolve customers' concerns.\r\n\r\n    Bishop, the former Labor senator who was part of the landmark inquiry into ASIC's performance that called for a royal commission, says such an inquiry is more necessary than ever.\r\n\r\n    \"The original inquiry called for a holistic approach to the issues,\" he says. \"It is that holistic approach that is being frustrated by the government, which is offering a piecemeal, uncoordinated approach.\"\r\n\r\n    A royal commission would also address shortfalls in protections for corporate whistleblowers. The banking industry's lobby group, the Australian Bankers Association, has promised to improve the treatment of whistleblowers, part of a suite of measures announced in April.\r\n\r\n    The banks said they would work with regulators to \"ensure the highest standards of whistleblower protections by ensuring there is a robust and trusted framework for escalating concerns\".\r\n\r\n    But Bishop and others believe stronger external protections for whistleblowers are needed. The biggest scandals that have hit the financial services sector were exposed by internal whistleblowers.\r\n\r\n    An investigation by Fairfax Media into IOOF exposed allegations of serious misconduct, insider trading, front running, cheating by senior staff and the misrepresentation of performance numbers for its funds.\r\n\r\n    The IOOF whistleblower said the way ASIC handled the investigation should be a call to arms for a royal commission.\r\n\r\n    He sent the regulator 59,000 documents and offered to help.\r\n\r\n    ASIC interviewed him for 35 minutes, which shocked him.\r\n\r\n    He said after 12 months ASIC produced a one-page press release that summed up its investigations and recommendations.\r\n\r\n    The press release identified a number of serious concerns in IOOF's research division including compliance arrangements, breach reporting, management of conflicts of interest, staff trading policy, disclosure, whistleblower management and protection and cyber security. Despite these findings, outlined in the press release, IOOF wasn't subjected to fines, sanctions, a banning order, enforceable undertaking or licence conditions amended.\r\n\r\n    \"What was the point of the investigation when they are not accountable and there is no transparency,\" he says.\r\n\r\n    Jeff Morris, a CBA whistleblower who called out wrongdoing in CBA's financial advice division, particularly star planner Don Nguyen, says the case for a royal commission into the banks has been made many times over.\r\n\r\n    Romesh Wijeyeratn worked for ASIC and the Commonwealth Bank. He's also given evidence at the parliamentary joint committee which led to the announcement of this week's inquiry.\r\n\r\n    He described O'Dwyer's inquiry as \"window dressing\" to avoid addressing the deeper systemic issues in the financial sector.\r\n\r\n    \"Up until today I was giving Malcolm [Turnbull] the benefit of the doubt,\" he says. \"I thought maybe he was genuinely looking for a way to fix the banks.\"\r\n\r\n    Rainer Mathews is still grieving for the loss of his wife. In March this year he wrote to the industryfunded Financial Ombudsman Service - one of the bodies under review by the Ramsay-led panel complaining about BankWest's behaviour.\r\n\r\n    \"I wanted the bank to look at the way that it had treated us, offer an apology and review its policies and procedures into the way it deals with hardship assistance for families facing, a terminal illness,\" Mathews says.\r\n\r\n    In June this year, two months after lodging the claim, FOS responded.

Perhaps it's no accident that many of the world's most beautiful places are the most inaccessible and require a stern test of human resolve to reach them.</abs><comtr xml:lang=\"en-US\">JULIE DANN</comtr><prg xml:lang=\"en-US\">Escape</prg><loc xml:lang=\"en-US\">Christchurch</loc><src xml:lang=\"en-US\">The Press</src><full xml:lang=\"en-US\">\n    Julie Dann explores Australia's remotest national park and settlement at the northern tip of the Kimberley region.\n\n    Perhaps it's no accident that many of the world's most beautiful places are the most inaccessible and require a stern test of human resolve to reach them.\n\n    Mitchell River National Park and Kalumburu Aboriginal Reserve certainly fall into this category, with the former being about 560km from the East Kimberley town of Kununurra.\n\n    The distance may not seem that great but the driving time - if completed in one, near-impossible hit - comes in close to 24 hours with many of the kilometres clocked up on the mighty Gibb River Rd, which cuts a predominately unsealed path east to west.\n\n    To get to the Mitchell Plateau, you need to head north for 160km on the less-travelled Kalumburu Road before tackling a 90km stretch and bone-jarring track, which in itself takes about three hours to complete.\n\n    This a road trip not for the faint-hearted, and can only be achieved in a high-clearance fourwheel drive during the dry season, which runs from May to October before the heavens open and transform the rugged landscape into a massive floodplain.\n\n    Before heading to the Mitchell Plateau we spent the night in the comfort of Drysdale River Station where a comfy bed and tasty tucker awaited before we stocked up on two essentials - fuel and drinking water.\n\n    At the heart of the plateau is Mitchell Falls, a stunning fourtiered waterfall - a powerful oasis amid the harsh, rugged, and unforgiving beauty of the Kimberley's red escarpments.\n\n    The Wunambal people have lived in this area they call Ngauwudu for thousands of years with the creative spirit Wanjina, whom they refer to as Gulingi, central to their beliefs.\n\n    They say Gulingi, and Wunggurr - the rainbow serpent, travelled the country creating the landscape before passing it on to them.\n\n    Indeed, there is something immensely spiritual about the plateau, of which about 115,300 hectares has been set aside as national park. The area is also of huge cultural importance for its indigenous rock art and biological significance due to its variety of unique habitats.\n\n    It boasts an incredibly rich diversity of flora and wildlife. The plateau is home to mangroves, swamps, woodlands, deep gorges and pandanus-lined creeks. The most conspicuous feature are the Livistona palms.\n\n    These fan palms can be found across the Kimberley along streams and waterfalls, but around Mitchell they totally dominate the landscape. They grow up to 18 metres tall and form a triumphant archway over the road into the national park that is almost claustrophobic, and contrasts with the more open nature of much of the Kimberley.\n\n    The palms create a strobe-like effect on the road and add to the hypnotic effect of the long bumpy drive.\n\n    We arrived at the Department of Parks and Wildlife campground dusty and tired. Be warned, the facilities here are basic - hybrid toilets provide the only home comfort, with the river offering some respite from the heat.\n\n    Being prepared is essential.\n\n    There is no running or drinking water available, no fuel, no power, nowhere to stock up on supplies.\n\n    It's a stark reminder that here humans need to be self-sufficient and you need to be at one with this isolated, natural world.\n\n    Our main destination at the national park is iconic Kimberley landmark Punanmii-unpuu Mitchell Falls - about a 8.6km round hike for which at least five hours should be set aside.\n\n    We opted for an 18-minute triple waterfalls helicopter flight operated by HeliSpirit.\n\n    We were flown downstream via the Mitchell River to Lower Mitchell Falls - where freshwater meets saltwater - before returning to our destination via JCR Falls. There's also a sixminute transfer to and from the falls. The bird's eye of the remote wilderness in the open-sided chopper is breathtaking and humbling.\n\n    By the time we landed at about 8.20am, the top of falls was thankfully relatively free of visitors, although some trampers had set off from base camp early to enjoy the serenity before tour buses descended.\n\n    The four-tiered falls plunge down about 80m and the power of nature is best observed from rocky outcrops on the opposite side of the gorge as the water elegantly pours from basin to basin. The view is incredible - a plateau of abundant vegetation stretches out to the horizon in a land built up by sandstone layers.\n\n    To get to the top of the falls, and the start of the hike back down, we needed to navigate a water crossing before the walk gets more difficult with rocky terrain, big boulders, clumps of spiky spinifex, and loose gravel.\n\n    Once navigated, the top of Mitchell Falls can be explored before heading to Big Mertens Falls. Walking along the edge of the narrow, dramatic gorge provides the best views, but extreme care is needed - it's a long way down.\n\n    The route back also boasts two sites with Aboriginal cave paintings and, further in, the walls are covered with delicate ferns.\n\n    The waterfalls at Little Mertens have great swimming spots at the top while the pool at the bottom provides a cool, refreshing dip before the 15-minute walk back to camp.\n\n    It's worth taking time to return to base from the waterfalls atop the plateau - not least for the rock art, which represent four stages in the Kimberley. There are irregular infill paintings dating back 30,000-40,000 years, which depict animals now extinct, such as the Tasmanian tiger.\n\n    A minimum age of 17,000 years has been established for the Gwion period, also known as Bradshaw art, which depicts humans in ceremonial garb. Then there's the clawed-hand artwork thought to be less than 7000 years old, and the Wanjina paintings.\n\n    The latter are the most recent style in the sequence at less than 1000 years, and depict deities in head-dresses with halos, no mouths, and large noses.\n\n    Birds are in abundance with the plateau supporting more than 220 species thanks to its habitats, which include patches of rainforest, eucalypt woodland, rugged sandstone ridges, mangroves and grass savannas an environment that supports everything from small frogs to large wallaroos and saltwater and freshwater crocodiles.\n\n    Many visitors to the national park simply focus on Mitchell Falls, but doing so misses out on other walks in the park, such as Surveyor's Pool (Aunauyu), which are surrounded by white bluffs of King Leopold sandstone.\n\n    There's also a 44km round trip to Port Warrender with its spectacular views of the Kimberley coastline. If this is too much of a trek, 3km from Surveyor's Pool is a lookout boasting views of the port and various islands.\n\n    No trip is complete without getting to the end of the road, and with this in mind we headed from the Mitchell Plateau to the Aboriginal community of Kalumburu - the most northern settlement in Western Australia.\n\n    An entry permit was not needed from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs when we arrived, but it's worth doublechecking this before setting off.\n\n    However, a visitor pass of $50 per vehicle still needs to be paid on arrival - money that benefits the local people.\n\n    We based ourselves at Kalumburu Mission's caravan park and campground, where there were also small double rooms known as \"dongas\".\n\n    The mission has serviced the region since 1908 when Benedictines first landed at Mission Bay on board the lugger San Salvador.\n\n    Our introduction to this farflung place was at the Father Thomas Gill Museum, named after one of the area's last monks.\n\n    It boasts a fine collection on the mission's work juxtaposed with local history, and Kalumburu culture and art.\n\n    We were shown around the mission's precinct by full-time volunteer Edmond, who seemed to be the main go-to man in town by helping out residents and visitors alike. He brought to life the area's past and present, which sees the mission working with the locals in what is a \"dry\" community - no alcohol can be bought or consumed here.\n\n    During our time in town, we were befriended by Roger, a local man selling his beautiful carved boab nuts, from which he earns much-needed income. We talked about his work, how the spirit Wanjina guides and nurtures the people.\n\n    We also called into the Kira Kiro Art Centre, part of a network of galleries in the Kimberley, where another warm welcome awaited.\n\n    After much deliberation, we opted for a wonderful painting by established indigenous artist Betty Bundamurra. She was born at a remote station where her father was a stockman.\n\n    Her mother gave birth to her in the bush. Aged three, her mother died and Betty went to Kalumburu Mission's convent.\n\n    After working at the mission baking bread, she worked at the town's school as a teacher's aid until recently.\n\n    The arts centre was established in 2009 with ongoing assistance from Waringarri Aboriginal Arts in Kununurra.\n\n    Artists paint with ochre pigments on to canvas, paper, and bark, and are also skilled slate and boab engravers.\n\n    Visiting the centre provided a valuable insight into the traditions and lives of these proud people, and it was a privilege to be afforded an opportunity to learn about their ways and culture.\n\n    But back to the road trip and the final destination - Honeymoon Bay, Western Australia's northernmost destination by 4WD, a place where the land meets the mesmerising Indian Ocean.\n\n    On the way, there is some Aboriginal rock art to discover on the Anscar and Monster Rock walking circuit before reaching McGovern Island Beach on the shore of Napier Broome Bay.\n\n    Then on to Honeymoon Bay where the road finally ends as Mission Bay becomes one with the horizon. Here the sand sparkles white and the sea glistens in hues of shimmering blue.\n\n    The walk to the beach from the campground is as serene as it is beautiful. A few small boats were bobbing up and down and, other than two fisherman discussing their trip, it was splendid isol ation at its most stunning. Sadly swimming is not recommended due to the saltwater crocs.\n\n    Few visitors venture this far north and that's a shame because a warm welcome awaits in Kalumburu and at its few nearby k beaches.\n\n    Honeymoon Beach and McGowans are the two main places to stay. McGowans boasts its own pet emu called Lager A second one, Export, sadly died.\n\n    As Edmond at the mission stressed to us, this part of the Kimberley would really benefit from increased tourism to support n its close-knit community.\n\n    As we prepared for the difficult, five-hour and 200km unsealed drive back to Gibb River Rd in the middle of nowhere yet everywhere, our thoughts turned back to boab-nut carver Roger, and his haunting, uplifting depictions of the spirit Wanjina.\n\n    We are sure she guided us back to safety from this remote, harsh, incredible wilderness.\n\n    s The writer travelled courtesy d of Tourism Western Australia, Air New Zealand and Virgin Australia.\n\n    Fact file More information: The Kalumburu Rd, from where it meets Gibb River Rd to the Aboriginal community after which it is named, is 262km long.

"fulltext": "\r\n    Julie Dann explores Australia's remotest national park and settlement at the northern tip of the Kimberley region.\r\n\r\n    Perhaps it's no accident that many of the world's most beautiful places are the most inaccessible and require a stern test of human resolve to reach them.\r\n\r\n    Mitchell River National Park and Kalumburu Aboriginal Reserve certainly fall into this category, with the former being about 560km from the East Kimberley town of Kununurra.\r\n\r\n    The distance may not seem that great but the driving time - if completed in one, near-impossible hit - comes in close to 24 hours with many of the kilometres clocked up on the mighty Gibb River Rd, which cuts a predominately unsealed path east to west.\r\n\r\n    To get to the Mitchell Plateau, you need to head north for 160km on the less-travelled Kalumburu Road before tackling a 90km stretch and bone-jarring track, which in itself takes about three hours to complete.\r\n\r\n    This a road trip not for the faint-hearted, and can only be achieved in a high-clearance fourwheel drive during the dry season, which runs from May to October before the heavens open and transform the rugged landscape into a massive floodplain.\r\n\r\n    Before heading to the Mitchell Plateau we spent the night in the comfort of Drysdale River Station where a comfy bed and tasty tucker awaited before we stocked up on two essentials - fuel and drinking water.\r\n\r\n    At the heart of the plateau is Mitchell Falls, a stunning fourtiered waterfall - a powerful oasis amid the harsh, rugged, and unforgiving beauty of the Kimberley's red escarpments.\r\n\r\n    The Wunambal people have lived in this area they call Ngauwudu for thousands of years with the creative spirit Wanjina, whom they refer to as Gulingi, central to their beliefs.\r\n\r\n    They say Gulingi, and Wunggurr - the rainbow serpent, travelled the country creating the landscape before passing it on to them.\r\n\r\n    Indeed, there is something immensely spiritual about the plateau, of which about 115,300 hectares has been set aside as national park. The area is also of huge cultural importance for its indigenous rock art and biological significance due to its variety of unique habitats.\r\n\r\n    It boasts an incredibly rich diversity of flora and wildlife. The plateau is home to mangroves, swamps, woodlands, deep gorges and pandanus-lined creeks. The most conspicuous feature are the Livistona palms.\r\n\r\n    These fan palms can be found across the Kimberley along streams and waterfalls, but around Mitchell they totally dominate the landscape. They grow up to 18 metres tall and form a triumphant archway over the road into the national park that is almost claustrophobic, and contrasts with the more open nature of much of the Kimberley.\r\n\r\n    The palms create a strobe-like effect on the road and add to the hypnotic effect of the long bumpy drive.\r\n\r\n    We arrived at the Department of Parks and Wildlife campground dusty and tired. Be warned, the facilities here are basic - hybrid toilets provide the only home comfort, with the river offering some respite from the heat.\r\n\r\n    Being prepared is essential.\r\n\r\n    There is no running or drinking water available, no fuel, no power, nowhere to stock up on supplies.\r\n\r\n    It's a stark reminder that here humans need to be self-sufficient and you need to be at one with this isolated, natural world.\r\n\r\n    Our main destination at the national park is iconic Kimberley landmark Punanmii-unpuu Mitchell Falls - about a 8.6km round hike for which at least five hours should be set aside.\r\n\r\n    We opted for an 18-minute triple waterfalls helicopter flight operated by HeliSpirit.\r\n\r\n    We were flown downstream via the Mitchell River to Lower Mitchell Falls - where freshwater meets saltwater - before returning to our destination via JCR Falls. There's also a sixminute transfer to and from the falls. The bird's eye of the remote wilderness in the open-sided chopper is breathtaking and humbling.\r\n\r\n    By the time we landed at about 8.20am, the top of falls was thankfully relatively free of visitors, although some trampers had set off from base camp early to enjoy the serenity before tour buses descended.\r\n\r\n    The four-tiered falls plunge down about 80m and the power of nature is best observed from rocky outcrops on the opposite side of the gorge as the water elegantly pours from basin to basin. The view is incredible - a plateau of abundant vegetation stretches out to the horizon in a land built up by sandstone layers.\r\n\r\n    To get to the top of the falls, and the start of the hike back down, we needed to navigate a water crossing before the walk gets more difficult with rocky terrain, big boulders, clumps of spiky spinifex, and loose gravel.\r\n\r\n    Once navigated, the top of Mitchell Falls can be explored before heading to Big Mertens Falls. Walking along the edge of the narrow, dramatic gorge provides the best views, but extreme care is needed - it's a long way down.\r\n\r\n    The route back also boasts two sites with Aboriginal cave paintings and, further in, the walls are covered with delicate ferns.\r\n\r\n    The waterfalls at Little Mertens have great swimming spots at the top while the pool at the bottom provides a cool, refreshing dip before the 15-minute walk back to camp.\r\n\r\n    It's worth taking time to return to base from the waterfalls atop the plateau - not least for the rock art, which represent four stages in the Kimberley. There are irregular infill paintings dating back 30,000-40,000 years, which depict animals now extinct, such as the Tasmanian tiger.\r\n\r\n    A minimum age of 17,000 years has been established for the Gwion period, also known as Bradshaw art, which depicts humans in ceremonial garb. Then there's the clawed-hand artwork thought to be less than 7000 years old, and the Wanjina paintings.\r\n\r\n    The latter are the most recent style in the sequence at less than 1000 years, and depict deities in head-dresses with halos, no mouths, and large noses.\r\n\r\n    Birds are in abundance with the plateau supporting more than 220 species thanks to its habitats, which include patches of rainforest, eucalypt woodland, rugged sandstone ridges, mangroves and grass savannas an environment that supports everything from small frogs to large wallaroos and saltwater and freshwater crocodiles.\r\n\r\n    Many visitors to the national park simply focus on Mitchell Falls, but doing so misses out on other walks in the park, such as Surveyor's Pool (Aunauyu), which are surrounded by white bluffs of King Leopold sandstone.\r\n\r\n    There's also a 44km round trip to Port Warrender with its spectacular views of the Kimberley coastline.

Rather, what matters is the ability of a business to adapt through decisions, strategy and execution.\n\n    The research shows that better leadership among the nation's 2.1 million businesses could produce a $70 billion opportunity for Australia's economy. This equates to a 4 per cent lift in GDP, or a $3000 dividend for every household in the country. As these figures show, investing in the potential of our leaders is an opportunity that simply cannot be ignored.\n\n    This puts the focus squarely on business leaders to determine the future of the businesses they manage. So what do leaders need to be as effective as possible? The research identified four characteristics.\n\n    First, great leaders need education that is appropriate for the life-cycle of their business. The study shows that leaders of successful established businesses are 43 per cent more likely to have a higher degree than the Australian average, compared to leaders in fast-growing businesses who are 22 per cent less likely to have one.\n\n    This suggests that over the life cycle of a successful business the education requirements of leaders change, which often results in the need to adapt training programs and take a hard look at recruitment processes.\n\n    However, higher education is just one aspect of the overall skill set great leaders need.\n\n    Second, successful business leaders require certain core skills that relate to running a business.\n\n    Established businesses need leaders that have mastered business process improvement and change management, while leaders of successful fast-growing businesses need great business development skills. These attributes help make businesses more agile in a commercial environment that is constantly shifting. At the heart of this is the ability of a business to tilt to specific strengths across its life cycle.\n\n    The third trait successful business leaders demonstrate is global experience. The study suggests the best businesses are two to three times more likely to have leaders that have worked internationally than the average.\n\n    When speaking with our customers I've seen first-hand that broader experience can often translate into better decision making.\n\n    Finally, business leaders need connectivity. This isn't about their digital skills; it's more about their ability to be connected to staff, suppliers and customers - and the business community more broadly. The research showed leaders of successful established businesses are 17 per cent more likely to be well connected than leaders of average businesses. For fast-growing businesses, this figure jumps to an incredible 88 per cent.\n\n    Ever since Westpac was formed almost 200 years ago, helping business leaders with drive and vision has been one of our most important priorities. As the largest business bank in Australia by customer numbers, we believe we have a responsibility to help make Australian businesses stronger. As we move into our third century, we are more committed than ever to the future of Australian business, launching a new program, Westpac's Businesses of Tomorrow. The core idea is to pick a small number of businesses that have the potential over time to change the face of Australian business for the better.\n\n    We are looking for 200 great Australian businesses of any shape or size, of these, 20 highpotential businesses will be selected to take part in an international study tour in the US and China, and will each receive $100,000 in professional services. These businesses will also be given the opportunity to participate in one-onone mentoring with one of the country's most respected business leaders and form connections with other like-minded entrepreneurs. Importantly, this program is not just about providing financial support to high performance organisations.\n\n    We are seeing an emerging theme around the interconnectedness of businesses. The report notes that more than half of small businesses receive the majority of their income from other businesses and over a third of large businesses have SMEs as their largest suppliers. Consequentially, we see the power of bringing big and small business together.\n\n    Our program is about forging connections between the best business leaders in the country.\n\n    The Westpac Businesses of Tomorrow program is designed to give our best businesses access to the practical knowledge, mentoring and networks they need to perform to their full potential one small step toward helping realise the $70bn opportunity the research uncovers.\n\n    David Lindberg is chief executive, business bank at Westpac We are seeing an emerging theme around the interconnectedness of businesses.\n\n    DAVID LINDBERG, WESTPAC</full></item></root>",

The research identified four characteristics.\r\n\r\n    First, great leaders need education that is appropriate for the life-cycle of their business. The study shows that leaders of successful established businesses are 43 per cent more likely to have a higher degree than the Australian average, compared to leaders in fast-growing businesses who are 22 per cent less likely to have one.\r\n\r\n    This suggests that over the life cycle of a successful business the education requirements of leaders change, which often results in the need to adapt training programs and take a hard look at recruitment processes.\r\n\r\n    However, higher education is just one aspect of the overall skill set great leaders need.\r\n\r\n    Second, successful business leaders require certain core skills that relate to running a business.\r\n\r\n    Established businesses need leaders that have mastered business process improvement and change management, while leaders of successful fast-growing businesses need great business development skills. These attributes help make businesses more agile in a commercial environment that is constantly shifting. At the heart of this is the ability of a business to tilt to specific strengths across its life cycle.\r\n\r\n    The third trait successful business leaders demonstrate is global experience. The study suggests the best businesses are two to three times more likely to have leaders that have worked internationally than the average.\r\n\r\n    When speaking with our customers I've seen first-hand that broader experience can often translate into better decision making.\r\n\r\n    Finally, business leaders need connectivity. This isn't about their digital skills; it's more about their ability to be connected to staff, suppliers and customers - and the business community more broadly. The research showed leaders of successful established businesses are 17 per cent more likely to be well connected than leaders of average businesses. For fast-growing businesses, this figure jumps to an incredible 88 per cent.\r\n\r\n    Ever since Westpac was formed almost 200 years ago, helping business leaders with drive and vision has been one of our most important priorities. As the largest business bank in Australia by customer numbers, we believe we have a responsibility to help make Australian businesses stronger. As we move into our third century, we are more committed than ever to the future of Australian business, launching a new program, Westpac's Businesses of Tomorrow. The core idea is to pick a small number of businesses that have the potential over time to change the face of Australian business for the better.\r\n\r\n    We are looking for 200 great Australian businesses of any shape or size, of these, 20 highpotential businesses will be selected to take part in an international study tour in the US and China, and will each receive $100,000 in professional services. These businesses will also be given the opportunity to participate in one-onone mentoring with one of the country's most respected business leaders and form connections with other like-minded entrepreneurs. Importantly, this program is not just about providing financial support to high performance organisations.\r\n\r\n    We are seeing an emerging theme around the interconnectedness of businesses. The report notes that more than half of small businesses receive the majority of their income from other businesses and over a third of large businesses have SMEs as their largest suppliers. Consequentially, we see the power of bringing big and small business together.\r\n\r\n    Our program is about forging connections between the best business leaders in the country.\r\n\r\n    The Westpac Businesses of Tomorrow program is designed to give our best businesses access to the practical knowledge, mentoring and networks they need to perform to their full potential one small step toward helping realise the $70bn opportunity the research uncovers.\r\n\r\n    David Lindberg is chief executive, business bank at Westpac We are seeing an emerging theme around the interconnectedness of businesses.\r\n\r\n    DAVID LINDBERG, WESTPAC",

But no matter how illconceived it might be, at least it will eventually fade away.\n\n    Not so the special banking tribunal advocated by NSW Nationals senator John Williams and north Queensland LNP MP Warren Entsch, which seems to be gaining support in the government. Quite what problem the tribunal is intended to solve, other than that of sidelining Labor's call for a royal commission, is unclear.\n\n    There is already a well-resourced Financial Ombudsman Service, which provides a low-cost process for resolving disputes between customers and banks.\n\n    And help is also available from the Small Business and Family Enterprise Ombudsman - who, at a cost to taxpayers of a mere $4 million a year, assures us that \"it's never been a more exciting time to be an SME\" - as well as from a Credit and Investments Ombudsman.\n\n    Nor does that trifecta of ombudsmen end the dramatis personae, as both the Australian Competition &amp; Consumer Commission and Australian Securities &amp; Investments Commission have ample powers to handle consumer complaints about financial services. In doing so, they can draw on a formidable armoury of consumer protection laws that prohibit contracts that are \"unjust\", \"unfair\", \"unconscionable\" or simply \"harsh\".\n\n    Moreover, should the regulators hesitate, the streets are crawling with ambulance-chasing solicitors looking for opportunities to launch class actions against the banks.\n\n    The real difficulty, however, is that the banks simply aren't being wicked enough for those claims to succeed.\n\n    Consider the law firm Maurice Blackburn, which is one of the ALP's largest donors and whose alumni include Bill Shorten and Nicola Roxon. Always keen to defend the downtrodden (unless they happen to be the employees of Cleanevent), it launched an allout assault on the nation's banks in 2010, funded by IMF Bentham on a \"no win, no charge\" basis.\n\n    At issue were the fees the banks charge, particularly for late payments on credit cards, with the lawyers claiming those fees broke every rule in the book. The NAB caved in, agreeing to a settlement whose generosity to the lawyers and their backers had even the Consumer Action Law Centre fuming. But with the ANZ sticking to its guns, Maurice Blackburn pursued the claims all the way to the High Court, using the late fees imposed on Lucio Paciocco as a test case.\n\n    The court's decision, handed down in late July, ought to be required reading. There was, the court finds, no reason to believe Paciocco did not know about the fees; nor was he coerced into holding the cards or incurring the charges. On the contrary, he \"chose to pay late, and thereby incur the late payment fee, as a matter of his own convenience\", so securing a source of ready finance.\n\n    Of course, once he had consumed the bank's lunch, Paciocco was not keen to pay for it. Yet were his payments waived, the costs the bank had incurred would hardly vanish; rather, \"interest rates or other charges could be expected to rise at the expense of those customers who adhere to their contractual engagements\". That, judge Patrick Keane dryly observes, \"might not be thought to be a good thing\".\n\n    Quite so; but Paciocco would certainly be delighted if instead of the High Court's legalistic fuddyduddies, a sympathetic tribunal had granted him his windfall.\n\n    And he would notice it, while the millions of law-abiding customers who ended up covering his tab would barely tell the difference.\n\n    With the benefits concentrated and the (hidden) taxes that would finance them thinly spread, pandering to the Pacioccos is the political path of least resistance.\n\n    But that path wouldn't end there. Having received his meal for free, our \"contract breaker\" (as the High Court calls Paciocco, in a throwback to the days when contracts meant something) would have every incentive to super-size it. And soon enough the trough would be crowded, as \"fairness\" ensured others were allowed to pile in.\n\n    With widows and orphans, the foolish and the indolent, jostling the farmers and the small businesses, it would quickly be standing room only.\n\n    The banks too wouldn't just stand by. If the politically favoured are to be subsidised, they would argue, the politically disfavoured must be gored; and that can only happen if they are deprived of viable alternatives. Whatever competition was left would then be further limited, giving the banks their share of the largesse.\n\n    Predicting the ultimate outcome is all too easy. As Charles Calomiris and Stephen Haber have recently shown in Fragile By Design, their comprehensive survey of the politics of financial crises, countries such as the US, where banks have been heavily used as instruments of income redistribution, end up with financial systems that are both inefficient and inherently unstable, combining highly concentrated, \"too big to fail\" lenders with borrowers who are induced by the subsidies to indebt themselves to the gills.\n\n    \"It is a rare populist government\", they conclude, that in the \"Game of Bank Bargains chooses policies that are conducive to both abundant credit and banking stability\"; and when the house of cards those governments build collapses, as it all too often does, it inflicts costs that for the median banking crisis amount to a massive 20 per cent of gross domestic product.\n\n    Adding yet more layers to our tangle of financial ombudsmen, regulators and regulations is therefore the exact opposite of what we need.

But that is one of the many achievements of Uber, a company founded in 2009 which is now the world's most valuable startup, worth around $70 billion. Its app can summon a car in moments in more than 425 cities around the world, to the fury of taxi drivers everywhere. But Uber's ambitions, and the expectations underpinning its valuation, extend much further: using selfdriving vehicles, it wants to make ride-hailing so cheap and convenient that people forgo car ownership altogether. Not satisfied with shaking up the $ioo-billion-a-year taxi business, it has its eye on the far bigger market for personal transport, worth as much as $10 trillion a year globally.\n\n    Uber is not alone in this ambition. Companies big and small have recognised the transformative potential of electric, self-driving cars, summoned on demand. Technology firms including Apple, Google and Tesla are investing heavily in autonomous vehicles; from Ford to Volvo, incumbent carmakers are racing to catch up. An epic struggle looms. It will transform daily life as profoundly as cars did in the 20th century: reinventing transport and reshaping cities, while also dramatically reducing road deaths and pollution.\n\n    The wheels of change In the short term Uber is in pole position to lead the revolution because of its dominance of chauffeured ride-hailing, a part of the transport market that will see some of the fastest growth.\n\n    Today ride-hailing accounts for less than 4% of all kilometres driven globally, but that will rise to more than 25% by 2030, according to Morgan Stanley, a bank. The ability to summon a car using a smartphone does not just make it easy for individuals to book a cheaper taxi. Ride-sharing services like UberPool, which put travellers heading in the same direction into one vehicle, blur the boundaries between private and public transport. Helsinki and other cities have been experimenting with on-demand bus services and apps that enable customers to plan and book journeys combining trains and buses with walking and private ride-sharing services. Get it right, and public-transport networks will be extended to cover the \"last mile\" that takes people right to their doorsteps. This will extend the market for ride-hailing well beyond the wealthy urbanites who are its main users today.\n\n    But in the longer term autonomous vehicles will drive the reinvention of transport. The first examples have already hit the road. Google is testing autonomous cars on streets near its headquarters in Mountain View. A startup called nuTonomy recently launched a self-driving taxi service in Singapore. Tesla's electric cars are packed full of driver-assistance technology.\n\n    And within the next few weeks Uber itself will offer riders in Pittsburgh the chance to hail an autonomous car (though a human will be on hand to take back the wheel if needed).\n\n    Self-driving cars will reinforce trends unleashed by ridehailing, making it cheaper and more accessible. The disabled, the old and the young will find it easier to go where they want.\n\n    Many more people will opt out of car ownership altogether.\n\n    An OECD study that modelled the use of self-driving cars in Lisbon found that shared autonomous vehicles could reduce the number of cars needed by 80-90%. As car ownership declines, the enormous amount of space devoted to parking-as much as a quarter of the area of some American cities-will be available for parks and housing instead.\n\n    It is not clear which companies will dominate this world or how profitable it will be. Uber will not win in its current form: a ride-hailing business which depends on human drivers cannot compete on roads full of self-driving cars. But this existential threat is spurring the firm's innovation (see page 17). With its strong brand and large customer base, Uber aims to establish itself as the leading provider of transport services in a selfdriving world. It is also branching out into new areas, such as food delivery and long-distance cargo haulage using autonomous trucks. There is logic in this ambition. Carmakers lack Uber's experience as a service provider, or its deep knowledge of demand patterns and customer behaviour.\n\n    But firms that pioneer new technological trends do not always manage to stay on top. Think of Nokia and BlackBerry in smartphones, Kodak in digital cameras or MySpace in social networking. Much will depend on which firm best handles the regulators. Technology companies have a history of trying new things first and asking for permission later. Uber's success in ride-hailing owes much to this recipe, yet when it comes to autonomous vehicles, the combination of vague rules and imperfect technology can have deadly consequences.\n\n    Even for the winners, it is not clear how great the rewards will be. As more firms pile into ride-sharing, and autonomous vehicles become part of the mix, the business may prove to be less lucrative than expected. By matching riders with drivers, Uber can offer transport services without owning a single vehicle, and keep the lion's share of the profits. But if its service becomes an integral part of urban transport infrastructure, as it hopes, Uber could end up being regulated, more highly taxed, broken up or all of the above. In a self-driving world, Uber might also have to own and operate its own fleet, undermining its \"asset-light\" model. The would-be high-margin digital disrupter would then look more like a low-margin airline.\n\n    The great road race For now Uber is the firm to beat in the race to transform the future of personal transport. Unlike Apple or Google, it is singularly focused on transport; unlike incumbent carmakers, it does not have a legacy car-manufacturing business to protect.\n\n    Its recent rapprochement with Didi, its main rival in China, has removed a major distraction, allowingit to devote its $9 billion war chest to developing new technology. Its vision of the future is plausible and compelling. It could yet prove a Moses company, never reaching its promised land-it might end up like Hoover, lending its name to a new product category without actually dominating it. But whether Uber itself wins or loses, we are all on the road to Uberworld.</full></item></root>",

Company A pays a salary to its CEO and company B sees that and increases its pay and the pressure comes back on company A to respond.\" Carter said his key message is that companies must attract and keep the best talent and that means paying competitive salaries. Board remuneration committees often end up being the \"meat in the sandwich\" trying to strike a balance between executives looking at what others are paid overseas and shareholders concerned boards are being too generous with their money, he said.\n\n    New Zealand only has a small pool of people with the skills to be a chief executive of larger listed companies and they have a range of options within the country and overseas, Carter said.\n\n    Executive pay is also lower in New Zealand than in Australia and Australia is behind the rest of the world, as executives are quick to point out.\n\n    \"Shareholders may not like it but the alternative is you may end up employing the B team and the results of that will be much worse for all shareholders,\" Carter said.\n\n    \"Pay peanuts and you get monkeys.\" - BusinessDesk Pay packets $4.7m Air New Zealand chief Christopher Luxon.\n\n    A$12.96m Qantas boss Alan Joyce.\n\n    A$3.7m Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti.\n\nCaption Text:\nAir New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon's remuneration has reached $4.7 million.\nPicture / Jason Oxenham.</full></item></root>",

Company A pays a salary to its CEO and company B sees that and increases its pay and the pressure comes back on company A to respond.\" Carter said his key message is that companies must attract and keep the best talent and that means paying competitive salaries. Board remuneration committees often end up being the \"meat in the sandwich\" trying to strike a balance between executives looking at what others are paid overseas and shareholders concerned boards are being too generous with their money, he said.\r\n\r\n    New Zealand only has a small pool of people with the skills to be a chief executive of larger listed companies and they have a range of options within the country and overseas, Carter said.\r\n\r\n    Executive pay is also lower in New Zealand than in Australia and Australia is behind the rest of the world, as executives are quick to point out.\r\n\r\n    \"Shareholders may not like it but the alternative is you may end up employing the B team and the results of that will be much worse for all shareholders,\" Carter said.\r\n\r\n    \"Pay peanuts and you get monkeys.\" - BusinessDesk Pay packets $4.7m Air New Zealand chief Christopher Luxon.\r\n\r\n    A$12.96m Qantas boss Alan Joyce.\r\n\r\n    A$3.7m Virgin Australia boss John Borghetti.\r\n\r\nCaption Text:\r\nAir New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon's remuneration has reached $4.7 million.\r\nPicture / Jason Oxenham.",

That is already down sharply from the minimum of 1500 hours set for typical nonmilitary pilots in 2013.\n\n    The proposal comes from a joint industry-labour group created by the Federal Aviation Administration to help it draft new regulations amid worries by the airline industry that there aren't enough pilots to keep up with demand. None of the recommendations have been released, and further details are expected to remain confidential until top FAA officials decide how to proceed.\n\n    Copilots without a military background or an academic degree related to aviation would still need at least 1500 hours of total flight time to be eligible to be hired by carriers. Copilots are sometimes called first officers.\n\n    The committee, which includes representatives of pilots, airlines and passengers, didn't recommend any changes for requirements to fly as a captain. Captains need 1500 hours among other requirements, but airlines usually require more flight time for them than federal minimums.\n\n    The proposals reflect escalating pressures many commuter carriers face in attracting and keeping enough pilots under existing regulations. Despite increased salaries and the introduction of signing and retention bonuses at some carriers, commuter operators remain particularly vulnerable to pilot staffing shortfalls.\n\n    Some commuter airlines worry they aren't attracting the overall quality of applicants they would like, while others fret about the impact of larger carriers hiring away commuter pilots with incentives that include higher pay and more secure career advancement prospects. Larger US airlines confront their own staffing issues with the impending retirements of tens of thousands of senior pilots over the next decade.\n\n    Industry initiatives so far \"haven't fixed the basic problem, just mitigated and probably delayed the worst consequences of the pilot shortage\", said Roger Cohen, former president of the Regional Airline Association, the leading trade association representing commuter operators. The group, which has been battling to change existing standards for years, declined to comment on the new recommendations.\n\n    In the past, regional carriers unsuccessfully pushed an initiative to reduce minimum experience standards for new aviators by having them sit in airliner jump seats as observers, subjecting them to more frequent proficiency checks and requiring beefed up stall-recovery training along with a year or more of formal mentoring by senior pilots.\n\n    Only about one-quarter of all US airline pilots now come from the military and its widely respected training program, according to Kit Darby, a consultant on pilothiring trends, and relatively few of those go to regional carriers. \"The assistance the proposals would provide is limited,\" he said.\n\n    An FAA spokeswoman said officials were reviewing the proposals.\n\n    The panel's report follows earlier safety enhancements imposed by congress and the FAA in the wake of the high-profile crash of a Colgan Air turboprop in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Investigators determined that the captain had a spotty training record and responded incorrectly to automated cockpit warnings.\n\n    Confronting pressure from politicians, outside safety critics and families of the more than four dozen victims who died in the crash, FAA officials in 2013 announced regulations raising experience and training requirements.

"fulltext": "\r\n    US airlines would be able to hire new pilots with far less cockpit experience than currently required under a proposal aimed at addressing a staffing shortage, a move likely to rekindle a debate over aviation safety.\r\n\r\n    Certain military pilots with as little as 500 hours of flying experience would be allowed to become commercial copilots, according to people familiar with an advisory panel's recommendations, compared with the mandatory requirement today of at least 750 hours. That is already down sharply from the minimum of 1500 hours set for typical nonmilitary pilots in 2013.\r\n\r\n    The proposal comes from a joint industry-labour group created by the Federal Aviation Administration to help it draft new regulations amid worries by the airline industry that there aren't enough pilots to keep up with demand. None of the recommendations have been released, and further details are expected to remain confidential until top FAA officials decide how to proceed.\r\n\r\n    Copilots without a military background or an academic degree related to aviation would still need at least 1500 hours of total flight time to be eligible to be hired by carriers. Copilots are sometimes called first officers.\r\n\r\n    The committee, which includes representatives of pilots, airlines and passengers, didn't recommend any changes for requirements to fly as a captain. Captains need 1500 hours among other requirements, but airlines usually require more flight time for them than federal minimums.\r\n\r\n    The proposals reflect escalating pressures many commuter carriers face in attracting and keeping enough pilots under existing regulations. Despite increased salaries and the introduction of signing and retention bonuses at some carriers, commuter operators remain particularly vulnerable to pilot staffing shortfalls.\r\n\r\n    Some commuter airlines worry they aren't attracting the overall quality of applicants they would like, while others fret about the impact of larger carriers hiring away commuter pilots with incentives that include higher pay and more secure career advancement prospects. Larger US airlines confront their own staffing issues with the impending retirements of tens of thousands of senior pilots over the next decade.\r\n\r\n    Industry initiatives so far \"haven't fixed the basic problem, just mitigated and probably delayed the worst consequences of the pilot shortage\", said Roger Cohen, former president of the Regional Airline Association, the leading trade association representing commuter operators. The group, which has been battling to change existing standards for years, declined to comment on the new recommendations.\r\n\r\n    In the past, regional carriers unsuccessfully pushed an initiative to reduce minimum experience standards for new aviators by having them sit in airliner jump seats as observers, subjecting them to more frequent proficiency checks and requiring beefed up stall-recovery training along with a year or more of formal mentoring by senior pilots.\r\n\r\n    Only about one-quarter of all US airline pilots now come from the military and its widely respected training program, according to Kit Darby, a consultant on pilothiring trends, and relatively few of those go to regional carriers. \"The assistance the proposals would provide is limited,\" he said.\r\n\r\n    An FAA spokeswoman said officials were reviewing the proposals.\r\n\r\n    The panel's report follows earlier safety enhancements imposed by congress and the FAA in the wake of the high-profile crash of a Colgan Air turboprop in 2009 near Buffalo, New York. Investigators determined that the captain had a spotty training record and responded incorrectly to automated cockpit warnings.\r\n\r\n    Confronting pressure from politicians, outside safety critics and families of the more than four dozen victims who died in the crash, FAA officials in 2013 announced regulations raising experience and training requirements. Instead of what had been the mandatory minimum of 250 hours flight time for first officers, the agency adopted a sliding scale from 750 to 1500 hours, depending on military and educational background.\r\n\r\n    Some agency critics contend the number of hours spent behind the controls of an aircraft, by itself, doesn't guarantee quality training.",

Emirates' double-decker A380 aircraft will fly between Christchurch and Dubai.\n\n    Christchurch Airport is the second New Zealand airport to host the superjumbo jet. Currently, Emirates and Singapore Airlines operate A380s out of Auckland.\n\n    Emirates' new A380 service will fly to Dubai via Sydney, cutting a stopover and about two hours off the flight time, the company said. Their new service would begin on October 30.\n\n    The airline already operated a smaller service, with a Boeing 777-300ER plane, between Christchurch and Dubai. This service required two stopovers in Sydney and Bangkok.\n\n    The change meant it would take longer for Emirates passengers flying between Christchurch and Bangkok.\n\n    Passengers who had already booked to fly to Bangkok from Christchurch would be moved onto alternative flights.\n\n    House of Travel marketing director Ken Freer said Emirates would organise for those passengers to fly to Auckland, where they would connect with an Emirates plane heading to Bangkok. This would likely add \"an hour or two\", to their journey, he said.\n\n    For travellers who had not yet booked, there were \"a lot of options to get into South East Asia\", Freer said.\n\n    Singapore Airlines operated services to Bangkok via Singapore. Travellers could still travel via Auckland and Sydney.\n\n    Freer said the A380 flights were \"great news for Canterbury travellers\".\n\n    He estimated there would be 35,000 extra seats into Christchurch each year, because of the larger plane.\n\n    \"The additional capacity will continue to put pressure on pricing,\" he said.\n\n    Travellers going across the Tasman would benefit the most from cheaper prices, he expected. Passengers looking towards Europe could expect lower prices too.\n\n    Christchurch &amp; Canterbury Tourism CEO Vic Allen said the new daily A380 flight was \"a huge endorsement for Christchurch\".\n\n    \"Having one of the biggest airlines flying their biggest aircraft into your airport, it puts you on the map,\" Allen said.\n\n    It made Canterbury and the South Island more accessible, which Allen thought would appeal to tourists.\n\n    Dubai was Emirates' central hub, with flights leaving to countries across Europe, Asia, Africa and Americas.\n\n    Allen thought Christchurch's increased access to Emirates' Dubai hub would benefit South Island tourism.\n\n    Emirates' A380 aircraft offered premium services, with the upper deck dedicated to business travellers. Their A380s in New Zealand had 14 first class suites, 76 business class compartments and 399 economy seats.\n\n    Allen said this offered an opportunity to strengthen premium tourism in the South Island.\n\n    \"The South Island of New Zealand is a premium destination . . . and that fits very well with the A380.\"\n\n    The launch of the Christchurch A380 flights would coincide with the introduction of the A380 on Emirates' daily nonstop route between Auckland and Dubai.\n\n    The journey to Dubai would take around 18 hours.\n\n    \"Having one of the biggest airlines flying their biggest aircraft into your airport, it puts you on the map.\"\n\n    Christchurch &amp; Canterbury Tourism CEO Vic Allen</full></item></root>",

Increasing employment outcomes and local participation in employment is a key objective of any government and it is particularly relevant given our current NT economic circumstances.\n\n    As a major employer of approximately 17,000 Territorians, the hospitality and tourism sector is wanting not only to sustain its current levels of employment but to also substantially grow the sector and employment levels.\n\n    The recent NT Careers Expos in Alice Springs, Nhulunbuy, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin highlighted for school leavers that there has not been enough training to meet the entry level jobs in demand. At a vocational education level, apprenticeships, traineeships and completion of VET courses in commercial cookery and hospitality are only meeting 5 per cent of the cookery job demands. Our industry will benefit from the long-term strategy of improving local participation in the workforce. We know that there will be jobs there for those who undertake the necessary skills training.\n\n    In the short term, our industry can benefit from targeted skill set training for both existing employees and potential employees. The training does not need to be certificatebased training but can be flexible, targeted skills training improving communication and customer service, regulatory compliance comprehension and competency such as in the service of food and beverages.\n\n    The AHANT supports the Labor proposal to promote the hospitality and tourism industry in Territory schools. The hospitality and tourism industry is a perfect place for young Territorians to start their careers on leaving school. It provides them with a wide range of career skills and options, not the least is a focus on customers and customer service. Our sector is a foundation employer, offering the first job for new job seekers, particularly those in the 18-25 age bracket.\n\n    We support the need for increased indigenous participation in the tourism industry.\n\n    Future growth in NT tourism will be strongly linked to increased indigenous workforce participation in indigenous tourism product.\n\n    The AHANT is very proud of the ever-growing indigenous workers in our industry.\n\n    Nitmiluk Tours /Cicada Lodge and Ayers Rock Resort have excellent indigenous staff who have progressed through the vocational education training system and are staff leaders in their field.\n\n    We support the ALP commitment to improve education opportunities for indigenous students as we will see increased employment participation throughout the NT.\n\n    In conjunction with Labor's schools proposal, it would be appropriate to examine other hospitality and tourism industry workforce development mechanisms in the vocational education and training and higher education sectors.\n\n    One proposal could be to expand their commitment and capacity to train, educate and provide the hospitality and tourism industry with local qualified staff in high priority occupations (such as cooks and chefs) as well as in supervision and management roles.\n\n    Developing our skilled capacity could also occur through a Government requirement for relevant Government agencies and outsourced service delivery and contracts to annually employ apprentices and trainees across hospitality related roles.\n\n    There is a strong industry preference, with associated benefits in terms of turnover and training, to employ locals, to build local staff capacity at all employment levels, and to reduce the industry's reliance on other competing interest groups from overseas and student worker, seasonal worker and working holiday maker employment sources.\n\n    The short-term collateral impact of low-entry numbers of local and other Australian workers into the sector is the continued reliance on backpacker labour, an international cohort aged 18-30 prepared to work and holiday in the NT.\n\n    It is a cohort that is under attack. The ALP committed to reversing the backpacker tax and has recognised the importance of backpackers to our tourism market and an important element of the workforce.\n\n    All stakeholders recognise the contribution that these international tourists make to the NT economy and until we have higher participation in local workforces we recognise the short-term reliance we will have on them as a labour source. We will need a strong NT Government to continue to advocate against the hike in the backpacker tax.\n\n    A strong hospitality and tourism sector is good for our regions and good for the Territory economy. Attracting and retaining more local Territorians to careers in hospitality and tourism is a major objective of the AHANT.\n\nCaption Text:\nCarl Davis from Apprenticeships Australia at the skills, employment and careers expo Picture: REX NICHOLSON</full></item></root>",

That when you see problems, you fix them.\n\n    That is my accountability and one I take seriously.\n\n    Everyone at NAB also understands we have a responsibility to the wider community to help build the economy.\n\n    This requires a complex and delicate balancing act that meets the needs of all our stakeholders - homeowners, businesses, depositors, mum and dad shareholders and superannuation funds representing millions of Australian workers, and retirees.\n\n    As Australia's biggest business bank, one of NAB's key focuses is to back people who are prepared to \"have a go\" - this drives economic growth and creates jobs and wealth.\n\n    People like Emma and Gary Nicholas-Jennings who have a gelato shop north of Melbourne in Pascoe Vale South. They had a dream of owning their own business and they got a $20,000 loan.\n\n    Less than two years later, their business Miinot Gelato provides a future for Emma and Gary and fulltime work for three other Victorians.\n\n    Each day we connect Australians who need access to credit with those who want a safe and secure place to put their money.\n\n    If banks get that right - and it requires the right culture, values and leadership - then business can grow.\n\n    Australians can borrow for a home, people can save for retirement and the whole economy benefits.\n\n    When the economy grows, there's more opportunity for our generation and the next.\n\n    That's why strong and sustainable banks are so important.\n\n    Each month NAB lends $2 billion to businesses - small businesses like Emma's and Gary's, and bigger companies that employ thousands of people and are the builders of our schools, hospitals, housing and new transport infrastructure.\n\n    ACH month we lend $4 billion to help people realise their Edream of buying a home.\n\n    We have access to this credit because we are strong and sustainable and provide a safe and competitive return for depositors.\n\n    We have 4.5 million retail and business customers who have deposited $320 billion with us.\n\n    Global investors have lent us $240 billion because they had confidence in our economy and the Australian banking sector.\n\n    There's our 584,000 mum and dad shareholders who invest their hardearned savings in the company.\n\n    And importantly the superannuation funds invest in banks to boost the retirement pool of millions of Australians.\n\n    Almost three-quarters of NAB's profits are distributed in dividends more than $4.5 billion last year. The remainder provides capital to lend or is invested in better services for customers.\n\n    Over the past year we've spent billions: $3.6 billion to our suppliers, $4.3 billion paying our 35,000 employees (including superannuation and other personnel expenses) and more than $2.5 billion in tax to the government.\n\n    This is achieved by striking a balance with all our stakeholders while participating in a competitive and highly regulated market.\n\n    If we don't achieve the balance, the potential impacts are extremely serious.\n\n    We witnessed this during the GFC when, while the Australian economy and banking system was the envy of the world, other economies were crippled, some banks collapsed and thousands of people lost their jobs and businesses.\n\n    Some countries are still experiencing the impact of high unemployment, few opportunities for young people and little or no access to credit for businesses or homebuyers.\n\n    We are proud of what we achieve each day at NAB but we know we have work to do. We need to listen more, explain our decisions more clearly and communicate better.\n\n    My drive is to serve customers and to do the right thing by them. It's an ambition shared by all of our 35,000 employees - many of whom live and work in the same community.\n\n    Every day we spend time listening to customers and reading what people are saying on social media.\n\n    And when we hear or read complaints we take them personally - because we should.\n\n    BANKING is a profession that requires trust, honesty and integrity and doing the right thing. We need customers and the community to have confidence in us and respect us.\n\n    That's why the NAB Executive Leadership Team has signed the Banking and Finance Oath and why we strengthened the integrity of our whistleblower program. If one of our people finds a problem, we want to know about it and deal with it.\n\n    We recently appointed an independent Customer Advocate to represent retail and small business customers and help them resolve the more serious complaints with the bank.\n\n    These are part of the six key Australian Bankers' Association industry initiatives, which all the banks have committed to.\n\n    As an industry, we want to be more transparent and give people confidence in our accountability to regulators - to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Financial Ombudsman Service.\n\n    Next month, the major bank chief executives will appear before the House of Representatives Economics Committee.

Two such examples are Guangzhou-based China Southern's pilot training school at Perth's Jandakot Airport, while Cathay Pacific and its regional wing Dragonair have been sending prospective pilots to Flight Training Adelaide for many years.\n\n    The question of pilot recruitment also comes down to economics.

A 2015 report from Aviation Week said the number of US students enrolled at four-year aviation programs at the Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University or the University of North Dakota were down \"significantly from pre-2002 levels\".\n\n    The report noted foreign students, particularly from the Asia Pacific, were filling those seats, citing not just the booming market in the region but also the prospect of moving directly to flying jet aircraft after obtaining their licence and \"several hundred hours\" of flight time.\n\n    In comparison, a US student with a four-year aviation degree required 1,000 hours of flight time to reach the same position, often at a \"regional\" carrier where salaries were about US$30,000 a year.\n\n    So will airlines offer higher pay in what has become a very competitive global marketplace for talented workers? Or will they relax entry requirements to open up the pool of potential candidates? And does this represent a compromise in safety standards?\n\n    There are no easy answers in this.\n\n    And as the issue of fatigue among the pilot corps around the world gains greater prominence, it is clear simply working existing pilots harder, while staying within limits imposed by the regulator, is not a durable, long-term What does China's burgeoning need for pilots mean for Australia?

You can be sure Air New Zealand chief executive Christopher Luxon knows what his counterparts at Qantas and Virgin Australia are being paid, he said.\n\n    \"This openness has had the impact of increasing executive remuneration,\" Carter said. \"Company A pays a salary to its CEO and company B sees that and increases its pay and the pressure comes back on company A to respond,\" Carter said.\n\n    Executive remuneration is typically made up of three components - fixed salary, short-term bonus usually paid in cash, and long-term incentives usually paid in shares to align management's interests with those of other shareholders. They can get complex as Luxon's current remuneration package shows.\n\n    Luxon got a $70,000 pay rise to his based fixed salary during the year to $1.47 million after the airline made record profits and $120,000 in superannuation. He was paid a short-term bonus of $1.62 million compared with $1.54 million in 2015 and under the long-term incentive plan he received performance right shares worth a total $808,500 compared with $770,000 the prior year.\n\n    In addition, under a six-year restricted share rights plan started this year aimed as a further incentive to retain his services for a long time, Luxon will receive share rights based on half his fixed pay. The amount is at the board's discretion and is tied to meeting performance hurdles. Vesting rights for the shares only kick in if he remains with the airline at vesting periods between 2017 and 2021. The restricted share rights granted this year were worth $700,000.\n\n    According to the accounts, Luxon owns or has a beneficial interest in 1.67 million shares but has to retain 618,504 as a mandatory shareholding in order to exercise any options of performance rights under his long-term incentive scheme.\n\n    How does his total $4.7 million remuneration package stack up against his counterparts? Alan Joyce at Qantas got a A$1 million pay rise this year to a total A$12.96 million after turning around the Australian airline's fortunes while some shareholders baulked at John Borghetti's A$3.7 million statutory pay and granting of share options after Virgin Australia plunged to an A$225 million full-year loss following restructuring of its business and fleet.\n\n    Carter said his key message is that companies have to attract and retain the best talent and that means paying them competitive salaries.\n\n    Board remuneration committees often end up being the \"meat in the sandwich\" trying to strike the right balance between executives looking at what others are paid overseas and shareholders concerned boards are being too generous with their money, he said.\n\n    New Zealand only has a small pool of people in with the skills to be chief executive of larger listed companies and they have a range of options within the country and offshore, Carter said.\n\n    Executive pay is also lower in New Zealand than in Australia and Australia is behind the rest of the world, as executives are quick to point out, he said.\n\n    \"To get Luxon back here from Unilever in North America we had to be competitive with what he earned there,\" he said.\n\n    \"Shareholders may not like it but the alternative is you may end up employing the B team and the results of that will be much worse for all shareholders,\" he said. \"Pay peanuts and you get monkeys.\"\n\n    Carter also said shareholders were unfairly focused on percentage increases for director fees rather than the overall dollar amount.\n\n    While he says he's paid fairly ($267,000 per annum for the Air New Zealand chairmanship alone), his directorships are on larger listed companies. He says fees paid to directors of medium-sized companies are too low to attract the people needed to govern them well.\n\n    (BusinessDesk)</full></item></root>",

You say 'can I change my ticket?'. No. 'Can I go to the lounge?'. No. 'Can I do the expedited security?' No.\n\n    \"But now, especially with millennials, people want to pick the price and the product experience and they want it personalised.\n\n    \"What ancillaries are about now is saying yes because the airlines all of a sudden recognise that if I do it within my existing supply chain, so if I don't change things dramatically, I can actually give people that choice.\n\n    It costs me nothing and they feel better about it.\"\n\n    A November 2015 report from IdeaWorks Company estimated airlines around the world would book ancillary revenues of US$59.2 billion in 2015, representing just under eight per cent of global airline revenue.\n\n    The figure is more than double the US$22.6 billion in ancillary revenues racked up in 2010 and up from 6.7 per cent of all revenue, as full-service and low-cost airlines alike continue to expand the range of buyup opportunities such as seat selection, points/mileage boosts, extra leg room, early boarding, food, in-flight entertainment, on-board will, lounge access and priority security.\n\n    Airline websites are also selling extras such as hotel bookings, car rental, travel insurance, overseas sim cards and tickets to local attractions, all of which earn commissions, as part of the ticket booking process.\n\n    Thomas noted that in the US some 70 per cent of ancillary revenue at full service carriers came from passengers paying for \"enhancements\" to the travel experience, rather than for \"takeaways\" such as bag fees.\n\n    \"For the full service carriers, again we've been very nervous about giving people choice,\" Thomas said.\n\n    \"In terms of ancillary revenues for the Australian market it is all about how can give people more choice.\"\n\n    Thomas cited Virgin's 777 as an example of the airline being ahead of the competition through giving passengers the ability to personalise their travel experience.\n\n    Within the economy cabin, the airline has created Economy Space+, featuring five rows of extra legroom seats that are available as a buy-up from an economy ticket, adding a quasi fourth class to the aircraft.\n\n    \"The 300ER is by far my favourite aircraft,\" Thomas said.\n\n    \"I am probably the biggest sales advocate for selling this aircraft because the economics of this aircraft are incredible.\n\n    \"It's big enough that you can actually do some innovative things in the cabin in terms of smaller cabins in economy and stuff like that.\n\n    \"We don't like to say it, but people don't like to travel. We all like to have control in our lives and what's as far away as having control in your life than sitting in an aircraft at 30,000ft hurtling throughout the sky? So if you can give some of the control back, if they feel like they are controlling, it makes it a better experience.\"\n\n    He was also a big fan of the ability to pay to boost the amount of miles earned for a flight either at the time of booking or checkin, which is currently something offered by the US carriers, believing it could be particularly attractive for travellers who only flew a few times a year.\n\n    \"If I am infrequent traveller and I am part of Velocity, I may never think I can actually get to a level where I can redeem the points so I don't ascribe a lot of value to those points,\" Thomas said.\n\n    \"All of a sudden if you, the airline, say, you can actually buy some additional points which all of a sudden take you from not being able to redeem to actually redeem, those points that had no value all of a sudden have huge value for you.\"\n\n    Virgin chief executive John Borghetti said at the launch of The Business in Los Angeles Thomas would join the company in September.\n\n    \"He will be group executive of the Virgin airline and he will be my right hand,\" Borghetti said.\n\n    \"John and I have been talking about some very interesting and innovative ideas. Watch this space.\"\n\n    Thomas's appointment was expected to free up Borghetti from some of the day-to-day management of the airline to focus on establishing Virgin's operations in China and Hong Kong as part of its strategic commercial alliance with HNA Group.\n\n    It can also be seen in the context of succession planning at Virgin.</full></item></root>",

"fulltext": "\r\n    As the head of LEK Consulting's global aviation and travel practice, one of John Thomas's jobs was finding ways for airlines to improve the bottom line.\r\n\r\n    To that end, in 2008 he was behind the introduction of checked baggage fees in the US, helping usher in the er^ of huge growth in so-called ancillary revenues.\r\n\r\n    That focus on ancillary revenues will also be part of his role as the group executive for Virgin Australia's domestic and international operations, as the airline targets a return to profitability after a posting a statutory loss in 2015/16 as a result of write-downs and one-off restructuring charges.\r\n\r\n    However, rather than taking something away something that used to be provided as part of the cost of a ticket, such as bag fees, Thomas said ancillary revenues were now more about giving passengers more choice.\r\n\r\n    \"The industry has got to get away from just selling on price, we've got to sell on product,\" Thomas told reporters on the sidelines of Virgin Australia's business class launch in Los Angeles on July 20.\r\n\r\n    \"In the past it was about having a generic product - you took the price you were given and it was just all very rigid.\r\n\r\n    \"The industry has always said no to people. You say 'can I change my ticket?'. No. 'Can I go to the lounge?'. No. 'Can I do the expedited security?' No.\r\n\r\n    \"But now, especially with millennials, people want to pick the price and the product experience and they want it personalised.\r\n\r\n    \"What ancillaries are about now is saying yes because the airlines all of a sudden recognise that if I do it within my existing supply chain, so if I don't change things dramatically, I can actually give people that choice.\r\n\r\n    It costs me nothing and they feel better about it.\"\r\n\r\n    A November 2015 report from IdeaWorks Company estimated airlines around the world would book ancillary revenues of US$59.2 billion in 2015, representing just under eight per cent of global airline revenue.\r\n\r\n    The figure is more than double the US$22.6 billion in ancillary revenues racked up in 2010 and up from 6.7 per cent of all revenue, as full-service and low-cost airlines alike continue to expand the range of buyup opportunities such as seat selection, points/mileage boosts, extra leg room, early boarding, food, in-flight entertainment, on-board will, lounge access and priority security.\r\n\r\n    Airline websites are also selling extras such as hotel bookings, car rental, travel insurance, overseas sim cards and tickets to local attractions, all of which earn commissions, as part of the ticket booking process.\r\n\r\n    Thomas noted that in the US some 70 per cent of ancillary revenue at full service carriers came from passengers paying for \"enhancements\" to the travel experience, rather than for \"takeaways\" such as bag fees.\r\n\r\n    \"For the full service carriers, again we've been very nervous about giving people choice,\" Thomas said.\r\n\r\n    \"In terms of ancillary revenues for the Australian market it is all about how can give people more choice.\"\r\n\r\n    Thomas cited Virgin's 777 as an example of the airline being ahead of the competition through giving passengers the ability to personalise their travel experience.\r\n\r\n    Within the economy cabin, the airline has created Economy Space+, featuring five rows of extra legroom seats that are available as a buy-up from an economy ticket, adding a quasi fourth class to the aircraft.\r\n\r\n    \"The 300ER is by far my favourite aircraft,\" Thomas said.\r\n\r\n    \"I am probably the biggest sales advocate for selling this aircraft because the economics of this aircraft are incredible.\r\n\r\n    \"It's big enough that you can actually do some innovative things in the cabin in terms of smaller cabins in economy and stuff like that.\r\n\r\n    \"We don't like to say it, but people don't like to travel. We all like to have control in our lives and what's as far away as having control in your life than sitting in an aircraft at 30,000ft hurtling throughout the sky? So if you can give some of the control back, if they feel like they are controlling, it makes it a better experience.\"\r\n\r\n    He was also a big fan of the ability to pay to boost the amount of miles earned for a flight either at the time of booking or checkin, which is currently something offered by the US carriers, believing it could be particularly attractive for travellers who only flew a few times a year.\r\n\r\n    \"If I am infrequent traveller and I am part of Velocity, I may never think I can actually get to a level where I can redeem the points so I don't ascribe a lot of value to those points,\" Thomas said.\r\n\r\n    \"All of a sudden if you, the airline, say, you can actually buy some additional points which all of a sudden take you from not being able to redeem to actually redeem, those points that had no value all of a sudden have huge value for you.\"\r\n\r\n    Virgin chief executive John Borghetti said at the launch of The Business in Los Angeles Thomas would join the company in September.\r\n\r\n    \"He will be group executive of the Virgin airline and he will be my right hand,\" Borghetti said.\r\n\r\n    \"John and I have been talking about some very interesting and innovative ideas. Watch this space.\"\r\n\r\n    Thomas's appointment was expected to free up Borghetti from some of the day-to-day management of the airline to focus on establishing Virgin's operations in China and Hong Kong as part of its strategic commercial alliance with HNA Group.\r\n\r\n    It can also be seen in the context of succession planning at Virgin.",

Almost half come to Australia independently, not with tour groups.\n\n    Although China is the second-largest source of visitors to Australia after New Zealand, it is heading to overtake NZ in the 2017-18 financial year.\n\n    On average, Chinese tourists stay for nine days and spend $5400 per person during their visit. In the year to March, they sent a total of $8.9 billion, more than the combined spending by the next biggest-spending tourist sources, Britain and the US.\n\n    The amount spent is growing by 38 per cent a year. They spend most of their money (58 per cent) on shopping, followed by 18 per cent on hotels, 11 per cent on transport, 6 per cent on food, and 4 per cent each on attractions and entertainment. Souvenirs and cosmetics head the items they buy.\n\n    While 55 per cent expected to eat a variety of Chinese and Western meals, 80 per cent chose to eat Chinese food most days, with only 33 per cent eating Western food.

We are afraid of finding it but we are also afraid of not finding it,\" Mr Bai, from China, said.\n\n    Jennifer Chong, from Victoria, said nothing had been the same for her and her two sons, aged 20 and 15, since her husband Chong Lin Tan's disappearance on MH370.\n\n    \"To me, it is frustrating that even after 21/2 years, we don't know what happened that night, what happened to my husband and where he is right now,\" she said. \"We continue to suffer as we try to find answers until we know what happened.\" Hui Jiang, whose 72-year-old mother Cui Yun Jiang was on the flight, called for more support for grieving relatives like him.\n\n    Grace Nathan, who also lost her mother Anne Daisy on MH370, said the disaster was unprecedented and, therefore, so was their situation.\n\n    \"With us, it's different to normal loss. First of all, we don't know what happened. Then we struggle with the fact we may never know what happened,\" she said.\n\n    \"On top of that, it's constant 21/2 years on. Something's always happening. There might a lull of three weeks, then someone will come up with some bizarre conspiracy theory.\n\n    \"That all throws us through a loop. I have to relive the horror again and again and I never get to recover from it. I never have time to grieve.\" Ms Nathan said she was in denial about her mother's fate.\n\n    \"I don't know when the turning point will come, when we will be able to accept and move on.\n\n    Finding the plane would be step in the right direction. We would still like to know why and how it happened. Then maybe, finally, we will find peace,\" she said.\n\n    The group's trips were arranged by Sheryl Keen, chairwoman of the Perth-based, Air Crash Support Group Australia.\n\nCaption Text:\nThe Fugro Equator search vessel has been hunting for the wreckage of MH370.
